      <title>The U.S.-China Economic Cold War Is No Longer Silent</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/us-china-economic-cold-war</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION —&lt;/strong&gt; For decades&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the United States (U.S.) operated under a fatal delusion that free trade with China would liberalize its politics and that the global market was a neutral playing field. We were profoundly wrong. In 2000&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the U.S. controlled 37% of global semiconductor fabrication. Today&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; we control less than 12%&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; while China is on track for 40% by 2030. While we played by the rules of Adam Smith&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; Beijing played by the rules of Sun Tzu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now in the midst of a silent asymmetric economic war. China does not have a private sector in the American sense. Under its strategy of Civil Military Fusion&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; every ByteDance algorithm and every ton of refined lithium is a dual use asset of the Chinese Communist Party. Meanwhile&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the U.S. encouraged the atrophy of its industrial base by prioritizing short term profits from outsourcing to China instead of securing our own economic and national security future. The West created this irrational strategic vulnerability where Beijing now controls 80% of refined rare earth supplies and more than 60% of the magnets in actuation systems for the F35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that economic security is national security&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the Trump administration has installed a genuine war cabinet for economic conflict. This includes the Treasury and Commerce Secretaries&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; but the pivot is most visible at the Department of War. There the Deputy Secretary, is a battle&lt;u&gt;-&lt;/u&gt; tested private equity leader who left his firm in order to bring his skills to fight and has operationalized a new offensive strategy to link private sector dynamism with state imperatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It’s never been more important to understand what’s happening in the world. Upgrade your access to exclusive content by &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;becoming a subscriber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tip of this spear is the newly chartered Economic Defense Unit or EDU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directly overseen by the Deputy Secretary of War and run by another private equity industry specialist in industrial consolidation, the EDU is not another regulator. It functions as an internal merchant bank designed to bypass the Pentagon’s notoriously slow procurement cycles. The EDU has replaced compliance&lt;u&gt;-&lt;/u&gt; based bureaucracy with commercial first financing. Its mandate is to generate investable demand signals using the government balance sheet to de-risk private capital investment in the defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of vague promises&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the EDU now utilizes Advance Market Commitments. These are binding contracts to purchase critical technologies such as solid rocket motors or autonomous drones before the factories are even built. This transforms government contracts into bankable assets that companies can use to secure private loans. Furthermore&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the EDU has restructured acquisition management&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; replacing narrow Program Executive Officers with Portfolio Acquisition Executives who are authorized to move capital rapidly across capability sets much like a private equity managing partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complementing this is the transformed Office of Strategic Capital or OSC. Once merely an advisory body&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the OSC has been re codified by the FY2026 NDAA into a direct capital allocator. It is aggressively bridging the valley of death not just for software but for heavy manufacturing. By offering direct loans and guarantees specifically for equipment finance&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the OSC ensures that American companies can afford the high capital machinery needed to onshore production of semiconductors and batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This architecture represents a total departure from the status quo. We are moving from a system that audits costs to a system that finances outcomes. The Army parallel initiative to grant Direct Commissions to Silicon Valley engineers further reinforces this culture shift – destroying the wall between the Pentagon and Palo Alto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message to the American private sector is clear. The era of neutrality is over. There is no free market left to win if China ends up owning the building blocks of every major industry. Wall Street and Silicon Valley must partner with the USG not out of charity&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; but out of necessity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration has built the financial and policy architecture for economic sovereignty. American capital now faces the simplest decision in its history, which is to deploy here and own the 21st century&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; or deploy elsewhere and become its tenant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The greenback’s effective depreciation on the trade side and its continued stability on the financial side will likely not last forever, at which point the US economy could be forced into a painful rebalancing. But until that day arrives, non-US economies should not assume that a weaker dollar will deliver the usual relief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Latin American and Caribbean region has weathered the increase in US import tariffs relatively well, although certain countries and sectors have been more affected than others. But the more fraught global trade environment has underscored the need to deepen ties with regional and extra-regional partners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Greenland’s Worth a Fight and Russia’s Trying to Start One</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/greenlands-worth-a-fight-and-russias-trying-to-start-one</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT PERSPECTIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;The “quickest way for Russia to penetrate our naval defenses is steaming from the Arctic to the North Atlantic.” The Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) Gap is the last place allied forces “have any hope of detecting a Russian sub before it’s in the vast Atlantic barreling toward New York.” These insightful comments were spoken not by President Donald Trump but by &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/__0Qubv3Dn8?si=bkhDFuCxgHg63TXE&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fictional President Grace Penn&lt;/a&gt; in Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;The Diplomat&lt;/em&gt;. By contrast Trump’s rhetoric and attempts to gain leverage on Denmark have been appalling and unhelpful. But Trump and “President Penn” are both right about one thing — although the Arctic island is remote, Greenland’s location makes it fundamental to U.S. and NATO naval intelligence and missile defense missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia knows this as well and is using the Trump-inspired kerfuffle to &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/russia-watches-us-european-tensions-greenland-glee-gloating-129427398&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drive a disinformation narrative&lt;/a&gt; intended to further weaken Euro-Atlantic relations. Kremlin-aligned sources have been circulating social media posts suggesting that Western aid to Ukraine has weakened European countries and that weaponry committed to Kyiv may be redistributed to Greenland. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsguardrealitycheck.com/p/russian-fakes-make-the-most-of-europes#:~:text=Actually%3A%20The,Kremlin%20bot%20activity.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deepfake&lt;/a&gt; of a Danish newscaster stating that Denmark plans to recall all F-16s given to Ukraine to be redeployed to Greenland was circulated by Russian influence accounts and received over 45.3K &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghostarchive.org/archive/e7tU3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;views&lt;/a&gt; on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsguardrealitycheck.com/p/russian-fakes-make-the-most-of-europes#:~:text=Another%20video%20imitated,sent%20via%20email.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, which received over 254.3K &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghostarchive.org/archive/UBxYr&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;views&lt;/a&gt; on X, imitated the Institute for the Study of War and claimed that Europeans siding with Ukraine in 2022 is costing them Greenland now and that NATO will be destroyed soon, thereby forcing Europeans to align with Moscow. This Russian &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscriber.politicopro.com/newsletter/2026/01/trumps-greenland-play-is-fueling-russian-disinfo-campaigns-00581185#:~:text=FUEL%20ON%20THE,Russia%2DUkraine%20war.%E2%80%9D&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tactic&lt;/a&gt; of riffing off legitimate think tanks and news channels to validate Russian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/09/26/how-u-s-adversaries-undermine-the-perception-of-election-integrity/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lies&lt;/a&gt; is essential to making their false pro-Kremlin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/10/29/foreign-malign-election-meddling-persists-but-struggles-to-gain-traction/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;narratives&lt;/a&gt; appear more credible and increase the likelihood of their posts spreading across social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow is trying to use the divide between the United States and Europe to sow confusion, degrade support for Ukraine, and rupture NATO. What Putin forgets is that disagreements between allies are common and constructively overcoming them builds stronger relationships. The strategic importance of Greenland demands the alliance work through its disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are significant reasons why Russia is trying so hard to split NATO over Greenland. Nuuk holds significant naval intelligence value. Moscow’s Northern Fleet and nuclear submarine HQ are on the Kola Peninsula, located near the Russia-Finland border. For Russian (RU) forces to reach the North and Baltic Seas, and beyond into the North Atlantic Ocean, RU submarines must transit through the GIUK Gap; making the two stretches of water critical for monitoring RU subsea activity, just as “President Penn” demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2025/7/16/just-in-china-russia-arctic-allyship-appears-to-grow-but-distrust-presents-roadblocks-report-says&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; between Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic and China’s increasing interest in the region over the past decade should raise red flags for NATO. In 2018, China released their first Arctic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2018/620231/EPRS_BRI(2018)620231_EN.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt;, in which they called themselves a “near-Arctic state” and detailed a desire to establish a “polar silk road.” Since then, China and Russia have performed numerous joint air and naval patrols in Arctic waters. Coordination between U.S. adversaries in the High North places an even higher value on NATO Arctic maritime intelligence capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenland is also strategically important for missile defense operations. Nuuk is a prime location for American early warning systems to track intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with trajectories that arch over the High North. The Pentagon currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://simpleflying.com/us-air-force-base-greenland-strategic-role/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;operates&lt;/a&gt; a variety of early warning radars and communications systems at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland.

      <title>Export Controls Backfire: The China Innovation Paradox</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/export-controls-backfire-the-china-innovation-paradox</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/this-aerial-photograph-taken-on-january-14-2026-shows-the-building-housing-the-headquarters-of-chinese-ai-startup-deepseek-in-h.jpg?id=63688027&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C53%2C0%2C54&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export Controls Backfire: The China Innovation Paradox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP DIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;When the Biden administration rolled out its semiconductor export restrictions in October 2022, the logic seemed airtight: cut off Beijing’s access to advanced AI chips, and you’d put the brakes on China’s tech ambitions. Three years on, that bet looks a lot shakier than anyone in Washington expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of paralyzing China’s AI sector, these controls have promoted domestic self-reliance. With no choice but to develop indigenous workarounds and architectural innovations, Chinese businesses are&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-progress-semiconductors-and-implications-us-national-security&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;rapidly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; decoupling AI progress from sheer hardware volume. U.S. policies have undoubtedly bought time, but they have also ushered in a parallel innovation ecosystem totally independent of Western influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the Trump administration is trying a different tack. By allowing conditional chip&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-08/nvidia-set-to-win-us-approval-to-export-h200-ai-chips-to-china&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;exports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to approved Chinese customers, complete with revenue-sharing arrangements, the White House appears to be hedging its bets. The strategy banks on maintaining some leverage through controlled access rather than outright denial. Yet critics caution this could backfire spectacularly: American companies might be financing the very Chinese AI capabilities designed to render them&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/consequences-exporting-nvidias-h200-chips-china&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;obsolete&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both strategies, it seems, lead to uncomfortable places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The DeepSeek Shock and Algorithmic Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, DeepSeek’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;new&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;R1 model sent tremors through Silicon Valley and Washington. The Chinese startup demonstrated AI reasoning capabilities closely mirroring those of OpenAI’s ChatGPT o1, without access to cutting-edge chips restricted by U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Algorithmic efficiency is a useful technique that enables developers to achieve reasonable performance compared to frontier models through inference-time optimization—essentially adapting the achievements of others for your own purposes,” Martijn Rasser, Vice President of Tech Leadership at the Special Competitive Studies Project, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “DeepSeek’s engineering is genuinely impressive, and this ‘fast follower’ strategy is very attractive for price-sensitive, commoditized AI applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By optimizing inter-chip memory bandwidth on less sophisticated H800 chips, DeepSeek&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/27/1109346/deepseek-r1-ai-model-china-breakthrough/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;achieved&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; competitive performance through algorithmic efficiency rather than brute force. According to the MIT Technology Review, Chinese startups are responding to export restrictions by prioritizing efficiency, resource pooling, and collaboration, thereby gaining an edge over competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough, however, should not be overinterpreted, Rasser warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Algorithmic efficiency and raw compute aren’t substitutes at the frontier — you need both,” he says. “Training next-generation foundation models, achieving breakthroughs in areas like protein folding or materials science, and developing the most advanced autonomous systems all require massive compute that efficiency gains alone cannot replicate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today. Gain access to save your virtual seat now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other analysts see the dynamic playing out along different timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI progress is shaped by two concurrent trends: pushing the capability frontier requires ever-greater computing power, yet over time, reaching any given capability level requires less and less computing power,” James Sanders, Research Associate at the Center for a New American Security, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While American AI companies continue advancing along the compute-intensive frontier, Chinese firms constrained by chip shortages focus instead on the lower-cost, lower-capability portion of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the U.S. continues to maintain its computational dominance, China will likely continue to play a role as a fast follower, rather than leader, in AI capabilities,” Sanders explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smuggling Networks and Systematic Circumvention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from inventiveness under constraints, Chinese companies have also shown remarkable versatility by smuggling goods through shell companies and elaborate smuggling operations. The procurement of chips for Huawei’s Ascend 910 AI processor is one of the most dramatic examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Congressional&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2024/11/combating-threats-from-china-s-semiconductor-industry&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;testimony&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Huawei used shell companies to deceive Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company into manufacturing approximately 2 million computer chiplets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, a smuggling ring operating under the company name “Luxuriate Your Life” reportedly purchased $390 million worth of&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/us-prosecutors-charge-chinese-national-with-illegally-exporting-ai-chips-2024-10-25/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;servers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Dell and Supermicro containing banned Nvidia graphics processing units, then smuggled them into Malaysia for ultimate delivery to Chinese customers. Hundreds of controlled chips have subsequently been sold in Shenzhen markets as vendors trade restricted AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dramatic scale of smuggling operations thus raises fundamental questions about enforceability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No export control regime is 100% leakproof,” Rasser acknowledges. “But the goal should be making evasion costly, risky, and limited in scale rather than expecting perfect enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He contends that the most effective approach is drawing a clear line: semiconductors exceeding certain performance thresholds should not be sold to end users in countries of concern at all, regardless of stated end use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders takes a more optimistic view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“America has the ability to reduce AI chip smuggling to negligible levels if it wanted to. It only requires the political will to do so,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology that verifies a chip’s location could reduce smuggling to negligible levels, Sanders argues, noting that Nvidia has reportedly built such a capability and several congressional bills have proposed mandating location verification for exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even with the level of smuggling we see today, export controls on advanced AI chips are still effective,” Sanders insists. “They impose a large differential cost on China’s AI development and make it much harder for these chips to be obtained and used by adversaries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Self-Sufficiency Acceleration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most significantly for long-term strategic competition, export controls have supercharged China’s decades-long quest for semiconductor self-sufficiency. At a February 2025&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/deepseek-moment-chinas-ai-ambitions&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;meeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between Chinese Communist Party Chairman Xi Jinping and technology executives, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei reported that his previous concerns about domestic advanced semiconductor production had eased due to recent breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CSIS analysis underscores that Ren stated he is leading a network of more than 2,000 Chinese companies working collectively to ensure that China achieves self-sufficiency of more than 70 percent across the entire semiconductor value chain by 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rasser is skeptical of the ambitious timeline.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This timeline is not credible for leading-edge semiconductors,” Rasser observes. “If he means trailing-edge components and packaging, 2028 might be achievable. But if he means the advanced logic chips that power AI training and high-performance computing, it isn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese firms still can't build the ultra-precise manufacturing equipment needed to produce chips at the most advanced nodes, he points out. But that hasn't stopped Beijing from doubling down. Overall chip investment dipped slightly in early 2025, yet spending on semiconductor&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SIA_Government-Incentives-and-US-Competitiveness-in-Semiconductor-Manufacturing_Jul-2023.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;equipment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; jumped more than 53 percent, a clear signal that China is dead serious about building out a complete domestic supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government has channeled well over $150 billion into semiconductor&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semiconductors.org/strengthening-the-global-semiconductor-supply-chain-in-an-uncertain-era/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 2014 through 2030, according to Semiconductor Industry Association analysis — an investment equivalent to the U.S. CHIPS Act virtually every year since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bifurcation Dilemma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unintended consequence of U.S. export controls may be accelerating the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iss.europa.eu/content/tech-war-escalation-deeper-look-us-chip-export-controls&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;bifurcation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of global technology ecosystems into incompatible, competing supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, we are faced with a strategic paradox: Does a China that relies on Western chips but is constrained by American controls pose a lower long-term risk than one that operates in a technologically autonomous fashion beyond American eyesight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A technologically autonomous China certainly poses a greater risk of strategic surprise,” Rasser concedes. “But the alternative framing — that we could maintain Chinese dependency on Western technology indefinitely—isn’t realistic. It ignores history, Chinese strategy, decades of mercantilist industrial policy, and the inherent difficulty of controlling technology diffusion over long time horizons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The better frame, he suggests, is that export controls buy time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The question is what we do with that time,” Rasser continues. “Years of constrained Chinese progress are years during which the United States and allies can extend their own technological lead, build more resilient supply chains, strengthen alliances with key semiconductor nations, and shape the trajectory of AI governance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders echoes this assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“China is determined to develop a fully domestic AI chip industry, and will likely eventually be able to do so,” he notes. “The real question is whether we equip China to compete with American AI leadership today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fundamental constraint on Chinese domestic AI chip production, Sanders points out, isn’t the lack of logic chips but access to advanced manufacturing&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/securing-semiconductor-supply-chains&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;equipment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strengthening and fully enforcing current export restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment is the most important step in preventing China from developing an AI chip industry that could outcompete America’s,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the competitive landscape extends beyond manufacturing capacity alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supply Chain War&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leland Miller, co-founder and CEO of China Beige Book, who serves on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, however, sees the entire framework shifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The trade war is dead,” he tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “This is a supply chain war. Beijing wants to weaponize supply chains for leverage. Tariffs are background noise now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller notes that China has advantages in data, talent, energy, and scale. Their weakness remains computing — advanced chips and lithography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why H100s matter so much,” he says, referring to Nvidia’s high-end processors. On open-source AI platforms like&lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Chinese dominance is already evident. “Seventeen of the top 20 models are Chinese,” Mike Kuiken, Vice Chair of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Software plus enough hardware can close gaps. That’s why this moment is dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s December 2025&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/us-allows-conditional-export-nvidia-h200-chips-china-2025-12-15/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;decision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to allow conditional exports of Nvidia H200 chips to approved Chinese customers in exchange for a 25 percent revenue stake represents recognition that absolute denial may be neither achievable nor desirable. Yet Beijing has reportedly discouraged state-linked firms from adopting these chips, while Chinese companies like Huawei and Alibaba continue to advance domestic AI alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controls have bought time — China’s AI development has slowed, and the U.S. still holds the edge in cutting-edge tech. The more complex question is whether Washington can consolidate that lead before Beijing circumvents the restrictions entirely, potentially causing an even bigger crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal isn’t perpetual dependency, it’s ensuring that when China does achieve greater autonomy, the strategic balance still favors us,” Rasser concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>The Rise of China's Strategic Soft Power and its Global Impact</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-rise-of-china-s-strategic-soft-power-and-its-global-impact</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT PERSPECTIVE&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; The United States is currently mired in a cycle of aggressive trade renegotiations and a transactional foreign policy that has alienated its most critical allies. By perceiving partners as free riders on American defense investments, Washington is increasingly defaulting to raw financial and military coercion, or hard power. While cultural attraction remains a core Western strength, this shift toward transactionalism is allowing the global power balance to tilt decisively in China’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has successfully evolved from the world’s manufacturing engine into an innovation powerhouse, with massive investments in research and development now yielding strategic dividends. The old adage, &quot;USA innovates, China replicates, Europe regulates,&quot; is being rendered obsolete as Beijing takes the lead in high-tech research, dominates renewable energy supply chains, and weaponizes its monopoly on rare earth materials. This is not just a technological shift; it is the foundation of a new form of systemic influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soft power, the ability to influence through attraction rather than coercion, is now a primary battleground for Beijing. In its 2010-2015 5-Year Plan, China explicitly identified cultural products like computer animation, books, and social media as strategic priorities, and is expected to spend over $10Bn per year. Today, that strategy is manifest in TikTok, where international audiences are fed a curated diet of technological wonders and friendly diplomacy, while the domestic version (Douyin) remains strictly regulated. This curated reality leverages Western influencers paid to travel to China to marvel at bullet trains and flying cars, effectively masking the tightening grip of government control and persistent domestic poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silver screen has become a frontier for this historical revisionism. The evolution of Oriental Dreamworks illustrates the point: after the original Kung Fu Panda sparked national soul-searching in China over why a Western studio told their story better, Beijing forced a co-production model. This ensured that subsequent global hits, like The Abominable, which sparked international backlash for including the nine-dash line, served as vehicles for Chinese territorial and cultural narratives. Similarly, the success of The Three-Body Problem on platforms like Netflix signals a shift from passive consumption to the strategic export of techno-optimism, reshaping how the West perceives China’s past and future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately one of China’s most potent soft power assets, however, is its strategic silence. In a world defined by shock events, from the 2025 Indo-Pakistani conflict to the Venezuelan raids to arguing over Greenland, Beijing projects a calculated lack of surprise. While United States foreign policy is viewed as an erratic series of active disruptions, China markets itself as a pillar of stability. By refusing the role of global savior, Beijing avoids the inevitable backlash of interventions while presenting its intentions, most notably regarding Taiwan, as historic certainties rather than chaotic ruptures. This perceived predictability is the velvet glove that makes its authoritarian consistency look like a safe harbor for global markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/15/views-of-the-us-have-worsened-while-opinions-of-china-have-improved-in-many-surveyed-countries/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2025 Pew Research Center survey &lt;/a&gt;of 28,000 adults shows the favorability gap between Washington and Beijing closing fast. Even inner circle partners are decoupling: in &lt;strong&gt;Australia&lt;/strong&gt;, importance placed on economic ties with China (53%) has eclipsed the U.S. (42%) for the first time. In &lt;strong&gt;Canada&lt;/strong&gt;, reeling from American rhetoric regarding annexation and the Greenland crisis, favorability for the United States plummeted from 87% to 67%. &lt;strong&gt;Spain&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Mexico&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Brazil &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Argentina &lt;/strong&gt;all view the United States as their highest threat, while the &lt;strong&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;France&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Netherlands&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Germany &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Sweden &lt;/strong&gt;think of the United States as their second highest threat, only surpassed by &lt;strong&gt;Russia&lt;/strong&gt;. When the world’s most stable democracies begin to view the United States as a greater threat to their sovereignty than China, the global architecture of power has already moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This erosion between the United States and its NATO allies is precipitating a tangible financial and geopolitical divorce. As European pension funds signal a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rog0QA0s3WI&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pivot toward non-American assets and gold&lt;/a&gt; to hedge against United States volatility, Washington has resorted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-warns-retaliation-europe-sells-141827096.html?guccounter=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hard-power retaliation&lt;/a&gt;, to counter rising interest costs on its own federal debt, but risks further alienating allies. This shift is giving rise to a Western middle-power bloc, where leaders from Canada to the U.K. are bypassing United States hegemony to secure autonomous ties with Beijing, most recently shown in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm24k6kk1rko&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canadian trade deal with China&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-approves-china-plan-its-largest-embassy-europe-despite-espionage-fears-2026-01-20/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;London approving a new embassy&lt;/a&gt; before their prime minister is set to visit China next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Domestic Crisis of American Soft Power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States faces a disadvantage in this competition that is as much internal as it is external. While cultural attraction remains a Western strength, America is stuck in a cycle of political division and a pervasive internal culture war. This domestic fragmentation has direct geopolitical consequences, creating a soft power deficit by eroding internal stability and the reliability that allies previously took for granted. When a superpower’s domestic policy is defined by institutional distrust and crippling polarization, its foreign policy becomes erratic, swinging violently between administrations and leaving partners to wonder if today’s agreement will survive tomorrow’s election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this climate, Washington is increasingly defaulting to financial and military coercion, hard power, to maintain influence. By viewing alliances through a purely transactional lens, the United States signals that its leadership is no longer based on shared values, but on momentary leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Authoritarian Impact of the Chinese Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, China’s authoritarian system provides a strategic soft power advantage by ensuring internal dissent never detracts from international ambitions. While the United States is distracted by internal quibbling over social issues, Beijing’s centralized control allows it to project a facade of unwavering stability and consistency. The CCP’s absolute control over society prevents political in-fighting from slowing its global expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marketed reliability is a powerful tool. To many developing nations, the Chinese model, which prioritizes state security and economic growth over the perceived chaos of liberal democracy, looks increasingly attractive. China is expertly using this image to mask the reality of structural debt traps and economic coercion they have expertly laid in the Global South, particularly in Africa and Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this is also China’s greatest weakness. Democratic values, such as a free press, labor rights, data and public privacy and private ownership are values where the West, and America in particular, still is attractive and acts as a magnet. While China might be a partner, they might not be a role model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Collision Course with an Existential Vacuum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Transatlantic alliance is now on a collision course with an existential power vacuum. If the West fails to move past aggressive theater and nurture shared security architectures, it will cede the century to a model that demands compliance in exchange for short-term financial benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For any nation flirting with realignment toward China, the warning is stark: China offers immediate liquidity, but demands a level of sovereign collateral that eventually leaves the partner more vulnerable than it was before the investment began, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-economic-coercion-lessons-lithuania&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lithuania’s experience&lt;/a&gt; with economic sanctions has shown. Old alliances between America and Europe should not be so quickly forgotten. All indications are that Chinese soft power, backed by an undistracted authoritarian state, could eventually be followed by hard power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soft power should not be discarded so quickly. There is strength in a shared Western cultural heritage that attracts nations precisely because it avoids totalitarianism. However, if America cannot find a way to resolve its internal dissent and project a unified front, it risks losing the very American Example that once served as its greatest global asset, and part of its allies with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Disregard for scientific evidence by opponents of vaccination, led by US Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is producing exactly the harms experts predicted: disease outbreaks, preventable deaths, and the reversal of decades of progress in public health. The consequences could become truly catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump’s foreign policy rests on contempt for longstanding allies and a belief that force alone matters in international affairs. The path forward, as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney argued in Davos, lies in midsize democracies banding together to preserve what remains of the postwar order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deterrence fails not only when threats to act or retaliate lack credibility, but when the absence of credibility tempts adversaries into recklessness. A leader like Donald Trump, who cannot commit and is disloyal to even his closest allies, is not merely ineffective; he is dangerous because he tempts adversaries to act recklessly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>America’s Intelligence Satellites are Proliferating: Their Protection is Not, With Exceptions</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/americas-intelligence-satellites-are-proliferating-their-protection-is-not-with-exceptions</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;The pace of U.S. national-security launches over the past several months has been staggering. But buried beneath the impressive cadence is an uncomfortable truth: many of the most sensitive intelligence assets now orbiting Earth remain dangerously exposed to enemy action by hostile actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These assets are launched primarily by the National Reconnaissance Office and the U.S. Space Force Space Systems Command, operating under the National Security Space Launch program (NSSL). The government’s private-sector partners - SpaceX and United Launch Alliance (a joint-venture by Lockheed Martin and Boeing) provide the lift capacity using Falcon 9, the soon to enter operations Falcon Heavy (SpaceX), and the newly introduced Vulcan Centaur rocket (ULA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress has long recognized the importance of assured access to space. As the Congressional Research Service &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.jumpto.es/l/178c4d348dbce6e83dbaf7399ea03e15eec2b93c?notrack=1&amp;amp;u=179354&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. law mandates maintaining at least two launch vehicles capable of delivering any national-security payload to orbit. That policy has worked. The problem is what happens after launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past four years, most NRO launches fall into three categories. First are signals-intelligence satellites (SIGINT). Second are large, electro-optical imaging satellites (IMINT) - capable of extraordinary resolution, as the public briefly glimpsed when Donald Trump released an undegraded intelligence &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.jumpto.es/l/ae2956f5297b55ecee975f224fd7fd89cf3a0d0f?notrack=1&amp;amp;u=179354&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; in a startling lapse of operational security. Third are the Starshield (the name of the program) satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proliferated Architecture represents a strategic shift; its &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.jumpto.es/l/49522628c681abff983fa37fef6a40ecbe6f84bb?notrack=1&amp;amp;u=179354&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; is to establish &lt;em&gt;“the largest government constellation in history” &lt;/em&gt;consisting of hundreds of satellites with launches planned through 2029. There are roughly half a dozen missions planned for 2026. This project replaces the model of few exquisite, irreplaceable satellites, in favor of resilience through numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That logic is sound - but it applies unevenly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proliferation ensures continuity if adversaries degrade or destroy some satellites. Yet the most sensitive NRO platforms - large SIGINT collectors and high-resolution imaging satellites - remain singular, expensive, and irreplaceable. They are also increasingly vulnerable. Both China and Russia are fielding counterspace capabilities that include electronic warfare, cyber intrusion, co-orbital inspection satellites, and direct-ascent anti-satellite weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today. Gain access to save your virtual seat now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, America is hardening its communications backbone while leaving its crown jewels exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deterrence in space no longer comes from secrecy alone. It requires active protection: improved space-domain awareness, on-orbit maneuverability, electronic countermeasures, rapid reconstitution plans, and – ultimately - the willingness to impose costs on adversaries who threaten U.S. space assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has demonstrated it can launch fast, often, and at scale. The next challenge is more difficult and more urgent: ensuring that the satellites underpinning American military power and intelligence dominance can survive in a contested orbital environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starshield redundancy is a start. Protection of existing assets must be the next step. if a rival has the ability to blind, deceive, or degrade satellites, then a lack of clarity may emerge exactly when clarity is most needed. A lack of clarity in a crisis is a catalyst. In fact, space is crowded, competitive, and, more to the point, contested. The dangers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, kinetic anti-satellite weapons (ASAT) and debris. Anti-satellite weapons, such as one that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.jumpto.es/l/8eb465dc05d8e7c1dfd0a0c3bb758949b800c830?notrack=1&amp;amp;u=179354&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tested by China in 2007&lt;/a&gt; are some of the most threatening because they have the capability to destroy a satellite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, non-kinetic attacks, like dazzling, jamming, cyber-tampering, and spoofing. The greatest threats on a daily basis are also likely to be non-kinetic, meaning they are temporary or reversible, although still potentially operationally decisive. A threat &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.jumpto.es/l/8a6a1c6ba93ad27649db1954f3182e71cb2bcf4e?notrack=1&amp;amp;u=179354&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;assessment&lt;/a&gt; has found categories of threats such as electronic warfare, cyber, and directed-energy effects that are being developed and employed by hostile nations as part of their counter-space capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, co-orbital proximity operations and grey-zone activity. Proximity operations are activities that are legitimate in themselves. However, the same activities can be used for coercion, interference, and &lt;em&gt;“accidents on purpose.”&lt;/em&gt; The issue in this regard is one of attribution. This leads to a gray zone in which norms are important in addition to deterrence. In this regard, the U.S. Space Force has described space domain awareness (SDA) as &lt;em&gt;“the ability to perceive and understand the nature of space-based phenomena to inform &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://l.jumpto.es/l/299979f1c6cdba01aa3882a1e888fd6564cf5b1d?notrack=1&amp;amp;u=179354&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;decisions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy should be to combine these elite systems with more distributed architectures: more nodes, more paths, and more means of recovery. Resilience is about the need to ensure that the loss of one satellite’s signal does not cause the end of the entire mission. The Proliferated Architecture (Starshield) program is a step towards that direction. But it’s only one NRO project in place and has redundancies set in place. What can be done to protect other multi-billion satellites already in orbit and not part of a constellation of satellites?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, apply maneuver, unpredictability and mobility in space, which comes down to strong cyber protection for mission systems and ground networks, encryption and authentication to protect command and telemetry, anti-jamming techniques and alternative communication routes and rigorous integrity checks, such that analysts can rely on the data generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, engage in rapid reconstitution and continuity of operations including: pre-planned fallback modes, alternate tasking workflows, ground processing surge capacity, and alternatives for reconstituting capability with allied or commercial sources if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the problem is narrowed down to its core, ensuring the protection of single-operated NRO satellites can be achieved via better access to sensor data and faster decision cycles and a resilient architecture (combination of high-end assets and proliferated assets).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally important are end-to-end cybersecurity and integrity controls, debris-conscious operations &amp; sustainability in coordination with civilian agencies such as NASA where necessary and proactive deterrence through resilience and consequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NRO satellites are strategic tools, as they reduce uncertainties, detect deception, and enable decision advantage. The threats to these satellites, which are both kinetic and non-kinetic, are rapidly increasing in their sophistication and frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protection of such satellites has nothing to do with making space a battlefield for its own sake. It has to do with being able to see clearly enough to avoid mistakes that could escalate quickly in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to ensure such protection is not through a single technology but through a comprehensive approach that involves situational awareness, resilience, secure data communication, sustainable operations, deterrence and dispersion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump’s second term has been defined by unilateralism, militarism, and lawlessness, pushing constitutional checks and balances to their limits.

      <title>The 2026 National Defense Strategy:  No Surprises but Plenty of Mandate</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-2026-national-defense-strategy-no-surprises</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; The 2026 National Defense Strategy (NDS) follows closely the 2025 National Security Strategy, as it should. It also falls in line with the Department of Defense’s narrative and the actions they have taken regarding priorities. The NDS has four lines of effort:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defending the U.S. Homeland&lt;/strong&gt; - Homeland defense is the top priority, with the Western Hemisphere elevated above other regions. This includes border security, open lines of transportation (Panama Canal and Greenland), counter-narcotics operations, and countering adversary influence. This is not a surprise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deterring China in the Indo-Pacific&lt;/strong&gt; - The approach focuses on deterrence through military strength rather than confrontation, aiming to prevent Chinese dominance while avoiding conflict. The strategy emphasizes expanded military-to-military communication with Beijing to reduce conflict risks. It still cites China’s predatory behaviors and makes clear that China is the second highest priority. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasing Burden-Sharing with Allies&lt;/strong&gt; - The document argues that allies must significantly increase defense spending, pointing to a new global benchmark of 5% of GDP for defense-related expenditures. It also calls on allies to keep watch against threats in their part of the world so that the US can focus on the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revitalizing the U.S. Defense Industrial Base&lt;/strong&gt; - Described as a once-in-a-century effort essential for military readiness, providing strength to deter the US from getting embroiled in a war, and, if needed, the ability to produce weapons at scale during crises. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable Omissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The strategy makes no specific mention of or guarantee to Taiwan, unlike the 2022 Biden era strategy which explicitly supported Taiwan's self-defense. It also omits climate change as a security threat, which the Biden administration had identified.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps, the most concerning issue is that the NDS does not mention Ukraine. It would have been easy to call out Ukraine’s successes against Russia as the example for how the strategy forecasts the behaviors it seeks from our allies. It also characterizes Russia as a persistent but manageable threat, in effect relegating Russia at the end of the day as inconsequential to the US. This underestimates Moscow’s ability to cause havoc beyond Ukraine. It also is much like waving the red flag at the bull. Moscow will not like being considered a minor player on the world stage. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Cognitive Warfare Still a Thing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Defense Industrial Base is called out as important as is the need for weapons systems and platforms, there is nothing in the document about increasing activities in the cognitive warfare area. This is an area where the US needs to step up. There are statements throughout the NDS where one can read into the need for cognitive warfare. The NDS talks about providing options in the spaces prior to war and being ready if the US must go to war. These statements support increasing intelligence support and non-kinetic options for decision makers. Specifically, the NDS says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;…&lt;em&gt;this Strategy will ensure that we see things and the choices we need to make clearly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;For decisionmakers to “see things” and understand the landscape and to provide them options or choices they will need a strong intelligence community that can collect the information needed to provide warning and articulate the threats we are facing. This same community will then be able to analyze the adversaries’ responses to choices that we make and help inform decisionmakers on what path might work best.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;….&lt;em&gt;including by leading efforts to deter or defend against other, lesser threats&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, to deter adversaries, not only does the adversary have to fear your kinetic response but also what you can do behind the scene. Additionally, cognitive warfare can prep the battle space, even if we do not ultimately resort to a battle space. Influence operations could play a huge role in deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;·      ….&lt;em&gt;partner with ….other federal departments and agencies to reinvigorate and mobilize our great nation’s unrivaled creativity and ingenuity, re-spark our innovative spirit….&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statement seems to be here to support calls for increased irregular warfare activities. Creativity and ingenuity are the hallmark for cognitive warfare and the Department can best support activities within the cognitive warfare or irregular warfare space by partnering with other federal departments and agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is nothing surprising in the NDS and that is a good thing. If the NDS had not closely matched the National Security Strategy or the direction we have witnessed the Department headed in the last year, something would have been off. What the NDS does do is provide the military and the Defense Intelligence Enterprise with a strategic framework for priorities. The National Intelligence Strategy should follow next. While the regional priorities in a National Intelligence Strategy should not be surprising, it will be illuminating to see the strategic direction that the Director of National Intelligence sets for how the intelligence community should move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NDS priorities mean that there will be some adjustments to resources. Reporting indicates that there may soon be changes to the unified command plan whereby US SOUTHCOM and NORTHCOM will be combined into an America’s Command. There will also need to be an adjustment to resources, both money and people to be able to fulfill the NDS mandate. Such a change will take time to build. Expertise does not come overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department will need to make major changes in acquisition and contracting to be able to develop the capabilities the NDS has called out and in the time frame it demands. It is clear that the Department is moving in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are repercussions for our partners and our adversaries. More will be expected of our partners but again, the administration has been clear on that issue and when pressed, our partners have shown that they can step up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Finally, the NDS is clear that the US is not looking for a fight. However, it is also clear that if our adversaries move in that direction, we will be prepared to push back. We need to make sure that we are and put more focus on cognitive warfare to help us be prepared but also to keep us out of a kinetic fight!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>China’s Stunning Military Purge – and What It Means For Taiwan</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/chinas-stunning-military-purge-and-what-it-means-for-taiwan</link>

Zhang and Liu were members of the Central Military Commission, or CMC, China’s most important military body – and Xi’s campaign has now claimed all but two of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/expressions/purge-zhang-youxia-reading-chinas-army-party-relations-through-tea-leaves&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;CMC’s six leaders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (one of whom is Xi himself). Xi’s earlier purges have ended the careers of dozens of lower-ranking generals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The PLA’s core command has been mutilated by these purges,” Dr. Zi Yang, an expert on China’s military at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. As for the CMC, he said that “this organization…that is supposed to oversee quality military advice is more or less gutted. Who’s giving Xi advice on running an organization of two million military personnel?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine an American president firing all but one member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with several other high-ranking generals, while simultaneously preparing for a major military contingency, and you have some sense of what’s happening in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis Wilder, who served as a senior CIA official and a top White House adviser on China, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/china/2026/01/24/what-xi-jinpings-purge-of-chinas-most-senior-general-reveals&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;called&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the moves against Generals Zhang and Liu the “most stunning developments in Chinese politics” since Xi’s rise to power – and said the purges would almost certainly affect any moves against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If Xi had plans for 2027, I think they’re delayed,” Wilder told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, referring to Xi’s directive that the military be prepared by 2027 to take taiwan by force. “I don't know for how long but they have to be delayed at this point. There's no way that they're ready to take on a major military confrontation in these circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gen. Zhang was widely considered Xi’s most trusted military aide. Former U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who attended a &lt;a href=&quot;https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/readout-of-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivans-meeting-with-vice-chairman-of-the-central-military-commission-zhang-youxia-of-the-prc/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;meeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with Zhang in 2024, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;that he “spoke in an unvarnished way that was typical of a military guy, but also reflective of someone who didn’t feel like he had to be cautious.” Now Gen. Zhang is the latest and most consequential casualty of Xi’s widening purge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s fair to say this is a seismic event,” Sullivan said. For Xi to “take out somebody who he had such a long history with is striking, and raises a lot of questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anatomy of a crackdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 24th the Defense Ministry announced that Generals Zhang and Liu had been placed under investigation for “suspected serious discipline and law violations”. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/3AYwV&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;editorial&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in China’s&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Liberation Army Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; said the two men had “trampled on” Xi’s authority and “severely undermined the party’s absolute leadership over the military.” Their actions, the paper said, had caused “massive damage” to the military’s political strength and combat readiness. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/china/chinas-top-general-accused-of-giving-nuclear-secrets-to-u-s-b8f59dae?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqc7eOBnepRsB3zOUMzXCx-OIWjKhBsH3_Gr7HKG4aus02Idlr9tAzQvrwK2yTE%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=697a4482&amp;amp;gaa_sig=bVwB7qjAHpuqirsR5vAE5eiaDRiWmrJVcOs2VP5fsIr03VTCkr9mVOZsGF7lzs7H-F8D4SeM0dY36_kB-eLNsQ%3D%3D&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that General Zhang has been accused of leaking nuclear secrets to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts had assumed that Gen. Zhang would avoid the purges, given his rare combination of attributes: a decades-long close relationship with Xi; and a decorated record during the 1979 border war with Vietnam. Few current commanders in China have experienced combat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Zhang matters, both as a combat-tested veteran – which is a very rare commodity within the PLA – but also because he truly understands war.” Shanshan Mei, a China defense expert at RAND and former advisor to the U.S. Air Force on China, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “He truly understands tactics and morale and real combat issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

He &lt;a href=&quot;http://v&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fired&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dozens of generals and began an overhaul of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), which was ultimately led by Gen. Zhang. Xi’s purging of the CMC leadership &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/china/2026/01/24/what-xi-jinpings-purge-of-chinas-most-senior-general-reveals&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;began in 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and culminated in last week’s moves against Zhang and Liu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Dr. Zi – the RSIS expert – wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamestown.org/five-key-factors-behind-irregular-leadership-changes-in-the-peoples-liberation-army/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;article&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about the purges and argued that Zhang Youxia’s removal would likely trigger a crisis within the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Now, Zi says, that moment has arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's going to have trickle-down effects for sure to the operational level,” Zi told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;“All of Zhang’s associates are going to be put under suspicion. All of Zhang’s underlings are going to feel the pressure as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it means for Taiwan – and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;that the latest ousters will likely have several immediate effects: a drop in PLA morale; less high-level risk-taking and innovation; a disruption in decision-making – involving everything from procurement to high-tech modernization to actual priorities and battle plans; and an almost-certain delay in any military operations against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambassador Joseph DeTrani, a former CIA director of East Asia operations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/inside-xi-jinpings-military-purge-loyalty-power-and-taiwan&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote an article&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;in October in which he warned that the high-level upheaval within the PLA might impact decisions involving Taiwan. Now he says that delays are inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got to say this is not going to happen [by 2027],” Amb. DeTrani told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “And if it is, you have got to wonder, what sort of planning and what sort of leadership would go in? I just don't see how President Xi Jinping could feel even remotely confident that China’s military would be prepared, or is prepared, to use kinetic means to take over Taiwan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zi said that the purging of the two top generals “has clearly damaged the PLA’s operational capacity,” and he, too, doubted that the military could move against Taiwan until the internal turbulence passes and a new leadership is put in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any war in the Taiwan Strait is going to be an extremely complex large-scale military operation,” Zi said. “It will require the mobilization of China’s resources in all realms and mobilization of basically all military services and forces. You need people who are capable and talented in positions to plan and lead these operations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilder said that while China’s basic military readiness is not in question – “pilots know how to fly their planes…(and) naval and infantry commanders know how to lead their units,” he said – the latest purges will compromise the oversight and execution of any major operations in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think this changes the readiness of PLA forces,” he said. “It’s really about the command structure. I think execution is a problem, because your command structure has been so disrupted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That “command structure” has been housed within the CMC, whose only remaining uniformed officer is Gen. Zhang Shengmin, who Zi described as a “political commissar with next to no operational command experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s not a combat veteran,” Wilder said of Zhang Shengmin. “You have to find a general in charge, if you're going to go forward with a plan. Who’s your operational commander?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Taiwan, Wilder said the purges risk a broader “paralysis” within the military’s top echelons. “You don't know what's safe anymore, and whether you might be investigated,” he said. “Officers will want to keep their heads down. They won’t want to propose anything. They will simply wait for instructions.” That, he added, will render the military leadership “dysfunctional for a while. It becomes incapable of serious decision-making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said decision-making wasn’t a problem for Gen. Zhang Youxia, who was seen as a straight-shooting advisor who wouldn’t hesitate to give Xi a less-than-rosy assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Zhang could give Xi Jinping critical advice and know that Xi would listen,” RAND’s Mei said. “A key question now is: Who is going to give Xi Jinping the Zhang Youxai-style, informed and combat-tested advice, if Xi decides to make any big moves militarily? Who’s going to give him the honest opinion?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amb. DeTrani said that morale at lower ranks will be challenged as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's got to affect the troops,” DeTrani said. “What is the message that Xi Jinping is sending to the troops – that his leaders are all either corrupt or involved in other nefarious activities? It's got to be very demoralizing for the core of the People's Liberation Army.” He said frontline soldiers may go so far as to question their own commitments. “I've been taking orders from these people and told to potentially give up my life to serve the country – and these people are feeding off the trough? They're corrupt and we're hearing that from our supreme leader? How could they expect us to sacrifice so much if they're not invested the same way as we are?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who will take their place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the near term, all eyes will be on the generals Xi taps to fill the vacancies – and how soon he does so. Wilder said that one of his “best contacts” inside China told him in the wake of the moves against Zhang and Liu that “There’s more coming. There are going to be other generals that go.” Any further bloodletting would suggest an extended period without a fully reconstituted top brass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever Xi chooses to fill the top-tier positions, he will presumably be looking for loyalists who also bring experience and expertise. But experts said that the trickle-down effect of the purges means that many candidates may be tainted by association to the ousted generals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In China, when you take down one person, everything about that person is wrong,” Mei said. “Who is going to replace Zhang? We keep looking one level down, to the theater commanders and political commissars. But many of these people were Zhang Youxian proteges. You take him out, it doesn’t mean that you will have a big collection of qualified, loyal military leaders ready to take over.” She added that among China’s ten theater commanders, “at least 4 or 5 are Zhang Youxian’s people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today.

The ideal citizens were &quot;Red and Expert&quot; – people who brought both elements to their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The real question is, can he find the loyalists he needs in those jobs?” Wilder said. “Does he have a slate of candidates? I would presume he cannot leave these positions open for too long.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My gut feeling tells me that Xi is valuing loyalty over professionalism,” Zi said. “A military professional may tell you things that you don’t want to hear. If he cannot find someone who is both ‘Red’ and ‘expert,’ he is going to choose someone who is loyal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zi and others added that whoever lands in these positions will have to tread carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They will have to be extremely cautious about their behavior, their words, they must carry themselves in a more subservient way,” Zi said. “Maybe even total obedience to Xi’s will and Xi’s mind. Because you don't want to put yourself in the same position as Zhang. And they won’t have anything like his capital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outside China, watching with interest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in Taiwan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-monitoring-abnormal-china-military-leadership-changes-after-top-general-2026-01-26/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week that they were closely monitoring what they called “abnormal shifts” within China’s senior military leadership. That said, Defense Minister Wellington Koo projected a nothing-has-changed approach, saying Taipei would not relax its guard, and noting that China’s war games have continued and Beijing has not changed its position vis-a-vis Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mei, Zi and Wilder all raised a concern about another regional flashpoint: The South China Sea. In their view, Xi may seek to quiet domestic concerns about the PLA – and send the rest of the world a message – by initiating a smaller-scale conflict involving those disputed waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would worry about the South China Sea, because Xi might want to prove that he’s still strong,” Wilder said. “So what do you do? You pick on a small guy. I’d worry about the Philippines. I think we’re going to have to watch for muscle-flexing of some sort.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zi voiced the same concern, suggesting Xi might seek a “rally-the-flag” operation in the South China Sea – a “small conflict that might be viewed as easy pickings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the U.S., the chaos in China’s military leadership offers at least one benefit: the gift of time, as Washington and its Asian allies consider the range of contingencies involving Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You've got a wonderful opportunity,” Wilder said. “Number one, you have time that you didn't have before. We have all these Indo-Pacom plans, we're trying to get AI in the field, drone swarms into the field. It gives us a longer timeline for working with the Japanese, the Philippines, the Australians. That's the good news.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Both US and Chinese leaders are guilty of personalizing the conflict-prone Sino-American relationship. Continuing down this path – particularly if Donald Trump’s degradation of American leadership becomes a permanent shift, rather than an aberration – raises the important question of which country is truly exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;European exporters depend more on the US market than American exporters do on Europe, which means the EU is poorly positioned for a tit-for-tat tariff war with the US. But with targeted export tariffs, taxes on royalties, and the elimination of US Treasuries' risk-free status, the EU could hit the US where it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Update on Venezuela, Post Maduro Apprehension</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/an-update-on-venezuela-post-maduro-apprehension</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT PERSPECTIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;Turmoil in Minneapolis and the unprecedented friction within NATO over President Trump’s effort to secure control over Greenland have, predictably, displaced headlines about Venezuela in much of the daily press. But there have been at least a number of important statements from the U.S. and one disturbing statement, reportedly, by Venezuela’s interim president since the U.S. apprehended Maduro and his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;”Now, this is not the end. This is not even the beginning of the end”&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Winston Churchill, 1942&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, in a press conference, President Trump said he was considering a role for Venezuela’s democratic opposition leader, Nobel laureate Maria Corina Machado. This was a very encouraging statement. The opposition has the support of the vast majority of Venezuelans. As has been widely reported and well documented, they won the July 24 national election by an enormous margin despite regime efforts to undermine their campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria Corina Machado is the leader of the opposition and a national hero. She is committed to rebuilding her country’s democracy and to reconstructing Venezuela’s dysfunctional and corruption-ridden economy. She is pro-American, pro-private sector and open to foreign direct investment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regime, now being led on an interim basis by Delcy Rodriquez, held on to power after the July 2024 vote through intimidation. The Venezuelan public knows this. And, despite assurances of cooperation to President Trump, there are already signs that the character of this authoritarian regime’s approach to governance has not changed. The regime moved quickly after the U.S. removed Maduro to squelch public expressions of relief that Maduro had been taken into U.S. custody. Left to their own devices, Delcy Rodriquez and company will do everything in their power to consolidate their hold on power. Indeed, this is clear from Rodriguez’s recent public statement that she has had “enough already of Washington’s orders over Venezuelan politicians.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating Maria Corina Machado into the transition process would reassure her supporters and help to counter the impression that the U.S. is indifferent to the plight of the Venezuelan democratic opposition. It would also contribute to the establishment of the kind of security on the ground that the American oil majors have said must be achieved before they commit to the immense investments necessary to resurrect the country much diminished and dilapidated oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump says the U.S. will manage the receipts for Venezuelan oil sales and direct some of that money back into Venezuela. Good but these funds should be channeled mostly into the hands of the opposition rather than the regime. Indeed, the last thing that should be done with the oil receipts is giving them to the regime. The regime’s managerial incompetence and corrupt practices are precisely what caused the effective collapse of the economy! As I and others have noted in the past, oil production in Venezuela has shrunk by two thirds since Hugo Chavez was elected. Things got even worse under Nicolas Maduro. The Venezuelan economy contracted by around 70 percent between 2013, when Maduro assumed the presidency, and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s decision to work with remaining elements of the Maduro regime’s leadership cadre was and remains understandable. The U.S. wants to avoid the mistakes we made after the fall of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. The regime’s remaining leaders, however, are never going to be willing partners in the reconstruction of, Venezuela if that means empowering their adversaries – as Delcy Rodriguez’s recent comment makes clear. They are counting on the U.S. losing interest or being distracted by other crises. The United States needs to be prepared to counter this heretofore unstated impression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. considered this a criminal regime before Maduro was apprehended. Rodriquez and the ministers of Defense and Interior were all a part of Maduro’s inner circle. They are miscreants who will revert to their previous patterns of repression and malfeasance absent close vigilance by the U.S. and the democratic opposition. This is why President Trump’s decision to get American diplomats back into the country and name a tough, experienced ambassador to lead the Venezuelan interest section presently located in Bogota was so important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has a long list of issues to work through with the Rodriquez team. Following Maduro’s capture, Rodriguez, on behalf of the regime, agreed to work with the U.S. to avoid further U.S. military action. We will need to watch carefully to be assured that commitments are met. We should also communicate persuasively that the U.S. is willing to act forcefully again if the circumstances warrant it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>Inside Trump’s New ‘Board of Peace’</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/inside-trumps-new-board-of-peace</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION &lt;/strong&gt;— “Donald J. Trump shall serve as inaugural Chairman of the Board of Peace, and he shall separately serve as inaugural representative of the United States of America…The Chairman [Trump] shall have exclusive authority to create, modify, or dissolve subsidiary entities as necessary or appropriate to fulfill the Board of Peace’s mission…The Chairman [Trump] shall at all times designate a successor for the role of Chairman. Replacement of the Chairman [Trump] may occur only following voluntary resignation or as a result of incapacity, as determined by a unanimous vote of the Executive Board, at which time the Chairman’s [Trump’s] designated successor shall immediately assume the position of the Chairman and all associated duties and authorities of the Chairman.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are quotes from the charter of the new, so-called Bureau of Peace (BOP) established by President Trump and signed January 22, at Davos, Switzerland by Trump for the United States and the leaders or representatives of 19 other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 16, White House announcement of BOP said the organization would provide “strategic oversight, mobilizing international resources, and ensuring accountability as Gaza transitions from conflict to peace and development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, six days later the BOP charter that President Trump released at Davos described its purpose in Chapter I this way: “The Board of Peace is an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No mention of Gaza, as BOP’s sole focus, but rather the far broader “areas affected or threatened by conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOP’s expansion to a worldwide peacekeeping role provides President Trump with a new way to involve himself in international affairs, not just while he is U.S. President, but even after he leaves the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will discuss below how President Trump sees all this happening and what it may mean. First, however, it’s worth seeing how BOP’s charter, gives its Chairman, Trump, total power over the organization even beyond what’s mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example,, the charter says. “Membership in the Board of Peace is limited to States invited to participate by the Chairman…Each Member State shall serve a term of no more than three years from this Charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the Chairman…The Executive Board shall be selected by the Chairman…shall serve two-year terms, subject to removal by the Chairman and renewable at his discretion…[and] shall be led by a Chief Executive nominated by the Chairman and confirmed by a majority vote of the Executive Board…Decisions of the Executive Board shall be made by a majority of its members present and voting, including the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive. Such decisions shall go into effect immediately, subject to veto by the Chairman at any time thereafter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Chairman Trump, under the charter, shall convene BOP meetings, establish their locations, must approve the agendas and the persons from all states attending those meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individually, the charter says Chairman Trump, “acting on behalf of the Board of Peace, is authorized to adopt resolutions or other directives, consistent with this Charter, to implement the Board of Peace’s mission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Chairman, Trump can also “dissolve [BOP] at such time as the Chairman considers necessary or appropriate, or at the end of every odd-numbered calendar year&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;unless renewed by the Chairman&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;no later than November 21 of such odd-numbered calendar year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charter says, “The Executive Board shall provide for the rules and procedures with respect to the settling of all assets, liabilities, and obligations upon [BOP’s] dissolution,” but remember, decisions of the Executive Board are “subject to veto by the Chairman at any time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the BOP charter gives Trump total control over the organization and all its activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last Thursday’s press conference introducing BOP, Trump said, “This Board [BOP] has the chance to be one of the most consequential bodies ever created and it's my enormous honor to serve as its chairman. I was very honored when they asked me to do it. We had an idea to do it, and then they came. They said, &quot;You be the chairman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump never explained who “they” were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although 50 nations had been invited to join BOP, only 19 showed up to attend last Thursday’s announcement. Major Western allies, such as Canada, France and Germany have balked and voiced concerns that the body is designed to replace the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, who just recently had the U.S. withdraw from many U.N. organizations, said at last Thursday BOP press conference, “I've always said the United Nations has got tremendous potential, has not used it, but there's tremendous potential in the United Nations and you have some great people at the United Nations, but so far it hasn't.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He repeated, “There's tremendous potential with the United Nations and I think the combination of the Board of Peace with the kind of people we have here coupled with the United Nations can be something very, very unique for the world, for the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the Trump approved as the BOP seal something in gold that’s very similar to that of the U.N. seal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who helped put together BOP and is a founding member of its Executive Board, said at last Thursday’s event, he had put together a plan for rebuilding Gaza with the help of the U.N. as the Security Council had originally voted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then Kushner added, “We've worked very, very well with them, this is why you need a new organization like the Board of Peace to work with the U.N.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kushner specifically thanked U.N.’s Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Tom Fletcher, who it turns out gave an interview to &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt; at the time of the BOP announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fletcher insisted, “The U.N. is not going anywhere…We’ve got to get out there, end wars, save lives, and we’re doing that.” Asked if Trump’s organization would replace the U.N., Fletcher responded, “Now I think we’re seeing America wanting to play a part in ending some of these conflicts and they want us [the U.N.] to be as effective as we can be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fletcher then gave a description of what I judge he sees as Trump’s different way of looking at how he, Trump, works with world leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fletcher said. “There’s a difference between the old school statecraft that’s familiar to many people here at Davos and a sort of real estate craft, which is coming into this conversation now, which is more transactional. It’s very focused on results, not process. It’s focused on personal relationships and not always institutions. Yes, there’s an aspect of cliff-hanger and jeopardy to it. We never quite know what’s coming next, but it is part of the conversation. And if it can save lives and it ends wars then that is fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me that is roll-the-dice diplomacy – in effect gambling on national security and foreign policy outcomes. Remember, Trump’s Atlantic City ventures that started in the 1980s. By 2004, all three Trump casinos and Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts Inc. were bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, has rolled the dice on Venezuela, let’s see how that turns out. And hopefully, BOP won’t be like Trump’s casinos, although right now it does not look to me like a good gamble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who thinks that fascism had been vanquished for good in the mid-20th century should look to Minnesota and other American cities. In Donald Trump's America, and perhaps coming to other countries soon, the panoply of fascism's strategies requires remarkably little updating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Russia’s War Economy Lifeline: Inside the Sanctions Evasion Network</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russias-war-economy-lifeline-inside-the-sanctions-evasion-network</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/18-january-2026-russia-moscow-the-kremlin-and-the-skyscraper-district-of-the-city-glow-in-the-afternoon-sun.jpg?id=63292808&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C53%2C0%2C54&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP DIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;Nearly three years into the most comprehensive sanctions regime ever imposed on a significant economy, Russia’s defense industrial base has not just survived — it has expanded at a rate that has stunned Western officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of Western import controls, Moscow maintains wartime levels of military production by using shell companies, third-country middlemen, and financial workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2026, the war will enter its fourth year, and Russia will still have access to&lt;a href=&quot;https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/00594bef40bc4148b16dc7267172d033&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;critical&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;battlefield technology that was banned by Western authorities. These components power the Lancet loitering munitions hitting Ukrainian positions, Kalibr cruise missiles striking infrastructure, and electronic warfare systems jamming NATO communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2025, Russia&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-nato-weapons-production-us-germany/33482927.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;produced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an estimated 250,000 artillery shells monthly — 3 million annually — according to NATO intelligence, while manufacturing over 1.5 million drones and more than 2,400 cruise and ballistic missiles per year. President Vladimir Putin&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-boosted-weapon-production-22-times-since-start-of-ukraine-war-putin-9998154&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;claimed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in April that Russia’s defense industry more than doubled production of weapons, communications, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare systems over the previous year, with ammunition production increasing more than 22-fold since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also assessed in January 2025 that Russia has fully switched to a “war economy” and produces, in three months, the weapons and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nato.int/en/news-and-events/events/transcripts/2025/05/21/joint-press-conference-1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;ammunition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the European Union makes in a year; a production advantage enabled by sanctions-evasion networks spanning three continents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Evasion of Western restrictions has helped Russia ramp up production of certain military equipment and munitions, such as cruise and ballistic missiles, to a greater degree than Western governments initially expected,” John Hardie, Deputy Director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Turkey-UAE-China Triangle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three countries have emerged as critical nodes in Russia’s procurement network. Over the past year, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and China continued to dominate Russia’s sanctions evasion infrastructure, collectively&lt;a href=&quot;https://hir.harvard.edu/fortune-hunting-russia-and-sanctions-evasion/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;accounting for&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 86.2 percent of total battlefield goods shipments and 78.6 percent of critical components shipments to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trade patterns reveal how entrenched these channels have become, and how enforcement efforts under the Trump administration have&lt;a href=&quot;https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10342/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;largely stalled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the first nine months of his administration, President Trump imposed no new sanctions on Russia and declined to join the UK, EU, and other allies in targeting Russian evasion networks. Only in October 2025, after canceling peace talks with Putin, did the Trump team&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cov.com/en/news-and-insights/insights/2025/08/trump-administration-imposes-secondary-tariffs-on-india&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;impose&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; its first direct sanctions on Russia, targeting oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil while threatening secondary sanctions primarily against India, despite China being the largest importer of Russian oil globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“China is by far the most important enabler of that evasion,” Hardie explained. “China serves as both a direct supplier of critical inputs — such as CNC machines, microelectronics, and nitrocellulose — as well as a jurisdiction for Russian illicit procurement of Western products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;China remains the dominant supplier, accounting for&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uscc.gov/research/chinas-facilitation-sanctions-and-export-control-evasion&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;up to 90 percent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Russia’s microelectronics imports. By August last year, Beijing exported a record 328,000 miles of fiber-optic cable and nearly $50 million worth of lithium-ion batteries to Moscow in a single month. According to Germany’s Foreign Ministry, up to&lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2025/11/china-is-the-weak-link-in-europes-ukraine-strategy?lang=en&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;80 percent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Russia’s sanctions circumvention now involves Chinese entities. Russia is paying the price for this dependence: Chinese suppliers&lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2025/11/29/russia-economy-china-trade-markup-sanctioned-goods-ukraine-putin/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;charged Russia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an 87 percent markup on sanctioned goods between 2021 and 2024, compared to just 9 percent from other suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the UAE has become the primary transshipment hub, with electronic component exports to Russia growing more than fifteenfold since the invasion. Dubai-based companies supply everything from aviation parts to Starlink terminals, which Russian forces&lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/2024/03/11/why-russia-has-been-so-resilient-to-western-export-controls-pub-91894&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;buy for around $2,200&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; each. By mid-2024, UAE imports of EU airplane parts hit 23.6 million euros — a&lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/09/russia-eu-sanctions-trade?lang=en&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;fifteenfold jump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — while Turkey’s climbed by a third to 12.7 million euros, even as Russia’s direct purchases fell to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central Asia’s Shell Company Explosion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central Asian states have become essential transit corridors, with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan serving as primary hubs. Throughout 2025, these channels have&lt;a href=&quot;https://lansinginstitute.org/2025/12/01/kazakhstans-expanding-role-in-russias-sanctions-evasion-architecture/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;grown more sophisticated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rather than diminished. From 2021 to 2022, Kyrgyzstan’s exports to Russia exploded by 250 percent, with machinery exports to Russia&lt;a href=&quot;https://thediplomat.com/2025/06/china-kyrgyzstan-and-the-quiet-construction-of-a-sanctions-resistant-trade-corridor/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;spiking&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by 41,000 percent — a figure that “cannot be attributed to market demand” but represents “economic statecraft hidden in plain sight,” according to analysis published in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian buyers keep setting up shell companies in Kazakhstan to purchase electronics and drones from Europe, China, and the United States, then ship them home to Russia’s defense industry. Throughout 2025, Kazakhstan&lt;a href=&quot;https://lansinginstitute.org/2025/12/01/kazakhstans-expanding-role-in-russias-sanctions-evasion-architecture/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;became&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; one of Moscow’s primary backdoors for sanctioned goods. Moreover, Russian marketplace OZON has invested significantly in logistics infrastructure across Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Armenia to consolidate parallel-import cargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diversions are obvious. Landlocked Kyrgyzstan&lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/09/russia-eu-sanctions-trade?lang=en&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;continues&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; importing EU maritime navigation equipment with no plausible domestic use — equipment destined for Russian naval systems. Over the course of last year, Western authorities intensified enforcement. In June, the UK&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/uk-warns-businesses-in-georgia-armenia-kazakhstan-uzbekistan-kyrgyzstan-aiding-russia-evade-sanctions-will-be-sanctioned-themselves/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;warned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; businesses in five countries that those aiding sanctions evasion would face sanctions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, the EU’s 19th sanctions package&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.matheson.com/insights/the-european-unions-19th-sanctions-package-against-russia-key-takeaways/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;targeted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; eight financial institutions in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, the UAE, and Hong Kong for facilitating circumvention, while four banks in Belarus and Kazakhstan were designated for using Russian payment infrastructures. In January 2025, the UK published enhanced&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d6303d4b-469e-4c5b-9c53-3566391ff873&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;guidance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; identifying 15 high-risk countries, including Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, the UAE, and Turkey, for which exporters must conduct enhanced due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how difficult it is to distinguish legitimate trade from sanctions evasion in Central Asia, Ambassador Daniel Fried, a forty-year career diplomat and Distinguished Fellow at the Atlantic Council, acknowledged the complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Such action is labor-intensive but worth the effort,” he tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “We should go after the most impactful technologies and targets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Yuan Lifeline: Russia’s Financial Engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan props up Moscow’s parallel financial system. As of November 2025, 99.1 percent of Russia-China trade settles in rubles and yuan — up from less than 2 percent before the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When&lt;a href=&quot;https://politicstoday.org/russia-and-china-settle-99-of-trade-in-national-currencies/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;major&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Chinese banks like Ping An and Bank of Ningbo stopped accepting Russian payments in mid-2024, smaller regional banks stepped in to fill the gap. These “burner banks” can shut down and reopen under new names if sanctioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workaround was part of a broader effort to rewire Russia’s financial system away from the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of Western currencies in Russian trade&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2025/number/2/article/china-russia-cooperation-economic-linkages-and-sanctions-evasion.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;decreased&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 87 percent to 18 percent between January 2022 and December 2024. Yuan and ruble filled the gap, eliminating Western oversight from the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today.

Though trade dipped slightly in early 2025 — Russian officials projected&lt;a href=&quot;https://russiaspivottoasia.com/russia-china-2025-bilateral-trade-to-exceed-us220-billion/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;around&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; $220 billion for the year due to market adjustments — the financial architecture remains entrenched, with the yuan accounting for&lt;a href=&quot;https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/going-steady-china-and-russias-economic-ties-are-deeper-than-washington-thinks/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;99.8 percent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Moscow Exchange foreign currency trading after summer 2024 U.S. sanctions targeted the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Enforcement Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are structural limitations to Western enforcement. The EU&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epc.eu/publication/sanctions-at-a-crossroads-developing-eu-leadership-amid-an-uncertain-transatlantic-alliance/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;lacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the capacity to check each and every export to a third country. Washington’s secondary sanctions strategy aims to catch violators, but effectiveness is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fried suggested targeted measures to disrupt these supply chains. Western enforcement faces structural limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Targeted sanctions and penalties from the Commerce Department,” he noted. “These are labor-intensive and only partially successful at best, but partial success can have an impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The January 2025 sanctions&lt;a href=&quot;https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2761&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;package&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; targeted nearly 400 entities across more than 20 jurisdictions. Throughout 2024,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/sanctions-by-the-numbers-2024-year-in-review&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;70 percent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. designations were Russia-related, with almost 33 percent targeting entities outside Russia — China accounting for 36 percent of third-country designations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not to say Western sanctions and export controls are useless,” Hardie underscored. “They do make life harder and more expensive for the Russian defense industry. And they have a greater effect on products with obvious military uses, e.g., radiation-hardened “hips for satellites. Sanctions also hamper Russian defense exports, which are an important source of revenue for the Russian defense industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese compliance is particularly complex. Beijing publicly respects Western sanctions yet operates on a principle of “everything not banned is allowed.” Smaller Chinese companies and regional banks keep supplying Russia while staying just within the letter of Chinese law. Beijing tolerates the arrangement as long as it doesn’t constitute a technical violation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

Russia has expanded its defense industry despite sweeping sanctions, leveraging enforcement gaps, asymmetries in global trade, and non-Western intermediaries that facilitate transactions for profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, analysts warn that structural strains are increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there is evidence for both trends, the stresses on the Russian economy are becoming larger,” Fried noted. “The Soviet experience is instructive; the USSR managed to continue its priority programs through the end, but the overall economy deteriorated little by little, and then all at once.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these gaps to be closed, secondary sanctions risk must be dramatically increased, import quotas must be imposed on third countries, or Russia must be granted access to critical technology at a higher cost and with greater complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardie, however, warned against relaxing pressure at a critical moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you need leverage to get Moscow to accept a peace deal, that’s hardly a smart time to make life easier for the Russian war machine,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The moral horror of ICE and Border Patrol agents executing US citizen observers is enough to denounce the Trump administration’s campaign of cruelty in Minnesota. But it is also important to recognize how it reflects the political logic of turning an entire country into a lawless border zone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>They're Coming for Our Kids: How Extremists Target Children Online</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/they-re-coming-for-our-kids</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;  September is National Preparedness Month - when we check our emergency kits, review evacuation routes, and prepare for natural disasters. But this year, as I sat in conference rooms at the Eradicate Hate Global Summit in Pittsburgh, I couldn't stop thinking about a different kind of storm brewing in our communities. One that doesn't announce itself with weather alerts or sirens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It targets our children in their digital third spaces - Discord servers where they chat with friends, Instagram feeds where they scroll for hours, Reddit forums where they seek community, gaming platforms where they unwind, and the sprawling ecosystem of social media where teenagers spend most of their waking hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, teenagers accounted for up to two-thirds of ISIS-linked arrests in Europe, with children as young as 11 involved in recent terrorist plots. But Islamic extremists aren't the only ones hunting in these digital spaces. White supremacist groups, neo-Nazi organizations, and other far-right movements have turned every corner of the internet where young people gather into potential recruitment centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What unites these predators across the ideological spectrum isn't their beliefs - it's their understanding that vulnerable children make easy targets. And while they've perfected their hunting techniques, we've dismantled our defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department issued a call for proposals in July 2025 to fund programs preventing terrorists from recruiting young people online. One month later, they canceled the entire initiative due to funding cuts. The very expertise needed to design and manage such responses had been dismantled when my office - the Office of Countering Violent Extremism - was shuttered along with similar prevention teams across the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're watching the storm approach, and we're sending the meteorologists home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New Hunting Grounds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every platform where teenagers gather has become a recruitment center for extremist movements. Neo-Nazi groups use gaming chats to spread white supremacist messaging. Islamic extremists exploit social media algorithms to target vulnerable youth. Far-right militias recruit through conspiracy theory forums. Anti-government extremists find followers in survivalist communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tactics mirror those used by online predators - build trust, isolate targets, gradually introduce radical ideas, and exploit vulnerabilities. A teenager struggling with social isolation logs into Discord seeking connection and community. Instead, they find recruiters who validate their frustrations while slowly introducing conspiracy theories, hate-filled content, and calls for violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The progression is methodical. First comes the meme that seems edgy but harmless. Then the private message offering &quot;real truth&quot; about current events. Next, the invitation to a smaller, more exclusive group where radical content flows freely. Finally, the encouragement to take action—whether spreading propaganda, targeting individuals, or planning violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren't random encounters. Extremist recruiters study adolescent psychology, identifying kids who show signs of depression, social anxiety, or family conflict. They understand that teenagers are naturally questioning authority and seeking identity—normal developmental phases that can be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History's Warning Signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exploitation of youth isn't new - only the technology has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hitler Youth movement systematically recruited children through youth organizations. The Red Army Faction in 1970s Germany drew from disaffected university students. The Irish Republican Army found fertile recruiting ground among marginalized teenagers in Belfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these historical cases teach us is that extremist movements succeed when they fill voids left by failing institutions. When young people can't find meaning, purpose, or belonging through legitimate channels, they become vulnerable to those offering simple explanations for complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's digital environment amplifies these vulnerabilities exponentially. Where previous extremists recruited face-to-face in specific locations, online recruiters can reach millions simultaneously, test messaging in real-time, and operate across borders with minimal detection risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Programs We Dismantled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevention infrastructure dismantled over the past year wasn't theoretical—it was saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the State Department, our team worked with tech companies to identify recruitment tactics and develop content policies that protected legitimate speech while removing extremist material. We helped content moderators recognize subtle grooming techniques that avoid automated detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships at DHS built relationships with schools and community organizations to identify early warning signs. Their approach was therapeutic, not punitive—providing intervention resources that addressed underlying issues rather than criminalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the FBI, specialized teams tracked recruitment networks and distinguished between teenage edginess and genuine threats. The Department of Health and Human Services funded research into psychological vulnerabilities that informed prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All shared common principles: early intervention beats prosecution; community solutions work better than federal enforcement; understanding radicalization psychology is essential for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Disinformation Amplifier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes today's threat environment particularly dangerous is how disinformation amplifies extremist recruitment while major platforms fail to enforce their own policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I write this, Houthi-linked arms dealers openly sell weapons on verified X accounts, advertising Kalashnikovs and equipment marked &quot;Property of U.S. Govt.&quot; The Tech Transparency Project identified 130 Yemen-based accounts advertising weapons, some with verification checkmarks. X even ran advertisements beneath these posts, generating revenue from terrorist-linked content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A teenager exposed to election fraud conspiracies becomes more susceptible to political violence messaging. Young people fed disinformation about minority communities become easier targets for white supremacist recruitment. Disinformation serves as a gateway drug to radicalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It’s never been more important to understand what’s happening in the world.

When she sought help, local resources that might have provided intervention had lost federal funding. A police officer described investigating a high school attack plot that might have been prevented if early warning systems remained operational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These costs are measured in broken families, traumatized communities, and young lives destroyed by preventable radicalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Preparedness Really Means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't wait for hurricanes before planning—we build early warning systems and maintain emergency capabilities. The same logic should apply to extremist recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need systems detecting concerning behavioral changes before they become threats. We need intervention addressing psychological vulnerabilities before recruiters exploit them. We need community responses providing support when families encounter these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news: we know what works. Community-based prevention programs have demonstrated success in interrupting radicalization. EXIT programs in Germany and Sweden help individuals leave extremist groups through mentorship and psychological support. The Against Violent Extremism network connects former extremists with at-risk youth. Montreal's Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence has successfully intervened in over 1,000 cases through family counseling and community partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Path Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding prevention infrastructure requires immediate action and long-term commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress must restore funding for prevention programs at State, DHS, FBI, and HHS. These aren't luxury programs—they're essential public safety capabilities protecting vulnerable citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must rebuild scattered expertise by bringing prevention professionals back from think tanks, universities, and private companies through sustained investment commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need stronger partnerships between agencies, tech companies, schools, and communities. Prevention works best at multiple levels simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents and educators need training to recognize early warning signs. This means providing basic digital literacy and threat awareness to identify concerning behavioral changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need counter-messaging strategies competing with extremist propaganda for young people's attention—empowering communities to tell better stories about identity, purpose, and belonging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Field Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention vs. Reaction:&lt;/strong&gt; Preventing one radicalized individual costs approximately $30,000. Investigating, prosecuting, and incarcerating them after violence costs over $3 million—not counting human costs to victims and communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; The most effective programs work through trusted institutions—schools, religious organizations, sports teams, youth groups. Federal resources can support but can't replace local relationships and trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reader Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Your Circle:&lt;/strong&gt; Talk with young people about their online experiences—not to interrogate, but to understand their digital worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Local Programs:&lt;/strong&gt; Find prevention resources in your community. School counselors and youth organizations often spot concerning trends before law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice Digital Hygiene:&lt;/strong&gt; Model good information consumption. Fact-check claims before sharing them. Ask questions about sources when your teen shows you &quot;shocking&quot; content. Demonstrate critical thinking by saying &quot;That sounds concerning—let's look up where this information comes from&quot; rather than immediately reacting emotionally. Young people learn more from observation than instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I flew home from Pittsburgh, I thought about my children and their digital world. The threats they face aren't visible from satellites or predictable through models. They emerge from the intersection of human psychology and technology in ways we're only beginning to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But September's preparedness lessons still apply: early warning, community response, and sustained vigilance. The storms targeting our children won't announce themselves with sirens, but they can be detected, understood, and prevented—if we're willing to invest in the tools and expertise necessary to protect what matters most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cipher Brief Expert Dexter Ingram also publishes on Substack &lt;a href=&quot;https://dexteringram.substack.com/p/ive-tracked-terrorist-networks-for?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Code Name: Citizen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/dec/23/pope-leos-world-day-peace-opportunity-put-words-action/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Next FATF Test: Can the West Demand Results from Pakistan?</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-next-fatf-test-can-the-west-demand-results-from-pakistan</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;In the shadow of Mexico City's historic Palacio de Bellas Artes, global financial watchdogs will convene in February 2026 for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Plenary and Working Group Meetings. In conference rooms far removed from South Asia’s violence, Pakistan will once again present itself as a responsible counterterrorism partner, armed with compliance reports, legislative amendments, and assurances of reform. On paper, Pakistan’s financial regulations increasingly resemble those of many developing democracies. On the ground, however, the networks that finance and enable terrorism continue to adapt and operate with troubling resilience. The widening gap between form and function is precisely what Western policymakers must confront as FATF prepares its next round of assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Compliance Illusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s removal from the FATF grey list in 2022 was widely portrayed as a&lt;a href=&quot;https://mofa.gov.pk/pakistan-exits-fatfs-grey-list&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;success story&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Officials pointed to new anti-money laundering laws, terrorist financing prosecutions, and institutional reforms as evidence of a course correction. FATF itself&lt;a href=&quot;http://fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Mutualevaluations/Fur-pakistan-2022.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;acknowledged&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; technical improvements, yet it also emphasized that effectiveness, not legislation, remains the ultimate benchmark. That distinction has proven critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open-source reporting and documented financial intelligence patterns suggest that terrorist organizations such as Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) have not been dismantled but rather modernized.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-pakistan-backed-lashkar-e-taiba-jaish-e-mohammad-s-new-tactics-for-anti-india-activities-exploiting-gaza-war-for-terror-financing-recruiting-3196528&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Recent documents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveal how these UN-designated outfits exploit humanitarian crises, such as the Gaza conflict, to funnel funds into terror activities. Under the guise of aid appeals and mosque reconstructions, figures like Hammad Azhar, son of JeM leader Masood Azhar, and Azhar’s brother Talha al-Saif orchestrate campaigns&lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/pakistan-based-jem-launches-rs-3-91-billion-fundraising-drive-after-losses-during-operation-sindoor/articleshow/123434708.cms?from=mdr&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;using digital wallets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like EasyPaisa, SadaPay, and JazzCash, aggregating micro-donations and cryptocurrencies to evade detection. These efforts aggregate micro-donations and cryptocurrency transfers, often employing fragmented wallet structures and chain-hopping across platforms to avoid detection. Funds have&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/months-after-operation-sindoor-setback-pak-terror-outfit-jaish-raises-funds-to-rebuild-2774256-2025-08-20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;reportedly supported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; militant infrastructure, including the establishment of more than 300 Mosques and the reconstruction of locations historically linked to LeT training facilities damaged during India’s 2025 Operation Sindoor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern reflects more than opportunism. Pakistan’s legal framework may align with FATF’s 40 recommendations on paper, but operational enforcement remains deeply inconsistent. Sanctioned individuals such as Hafiz Talha Saeed have&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/hafiz-saeed-son-talha-saeed-lahore-rally-pm-modi-pahalgam-terror-attack-india-pak-tensions-2720626-2025-05-06&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;led public rallies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Lahore under police protection, issuing threats against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In 2025, senior Pakistani legislature Rana Muhammad Qasim Noon&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/India/pak-rebuilding-muzaffarabad-terror-camp-destroyed-in-operation-sindoor-minister-visits-site/ar-AA1PHdR0?cvid=6908a8eda8264964b07b806b1720fa36&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;reportedly visited&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; militant-affiliated reconstruction sites alongside local officials, revealing overt collaboration between state and non-state actors. Recruitment drives&lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-operation-sindoor-major-pakistan-terror-groups-shifting-base-to-afghanistan-border/articleshow/124008707.cms&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;disguised as religious gatherings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, often coordinated with Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam networks, have featured speeches praising Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, delivered by JeM commander Masood Ilyas Kashmiri at facilities such as Markaz Shohada-e-Islam in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these cases point to a long-standing “management” model of extremism. Militant groups are not dismantled but rebranded, with political fronts such as&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-party-face-of-mumbai-attacks-mastermind-hafiz-saeeds-banned-group-to-participate-in-pakistan-general-election/article67812218.ece&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contesting elections while violence is normalized as a political instrument. As Greece-based policy analyst Dimitra Staikou has&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.europawire.eu/pakistan-when-the-state-does-not-fight-terrorism-but-manages-it/eu-press-release/2026/01/09/15/48/56/167603/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;argued&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this model exports instability through regional alignments and shields militancy behind formal democratic processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Militant violence has&lt;a href=&quot;https://crss.pk/three-quarters-of-2025-nearly-as-violent-as-entire-2024/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;surged significantly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, driven by attacks from the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan and Baloch insurgent groups. Rather than prompting a clean break with all forms of militancy, this instability risks reinforcing the proxy logic that FATF scrutiny is meant to dismantle. For Western policymakers, the danger lies in conflating cooperation with convergence in security priorities. Intelligence sharing, access agreements, or economic partnerships do not necessarily reflect aligned counterterrorism priorities. As I&lt;a href=&quot;https://millichronicle.com/2025/10/58400.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;argued previously&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Milli Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Pakistan’s strategic incentives continue to reward selective tolerance of militant actors, particularly those oriented toward India. FATF’s effectiveness framework exists to test whether states are willing to disrupt these incentives, not simply mask them with procedural compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FATF’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/comprehensive-update-terrorist-financing-risks-2025.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;2025 Comprehensive Update&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Terrorist Financing Risks underscores the urgency. The report highlights a marked increase in hybrid digital methods, consistent with Pakistan-linked entities shifting from banks to fintech platforms to evade oversight. Although Pakistan exited the grey list in 2022 after four years of economic strain, FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aninews.in/news/world/europe/exit-from-greylist-not-bulletproof-fatf-warns-pakistan-against-terror-financing20251025044030/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;warned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October 2025 that the removal was “not bulletproof,” citing unregulated digital transactions as a continuing vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico City should therefore serve as a turning point. US and EU delegations should press for outcome-based evaluations focused on sustained investigations, verifiable asset seizures, and the dismantling of facilitation networks. Particular scrutiny must be directed toward digital payment systems, informal charities, and micro-donation models that exploit regulatory blind spots. Western governments should also coordinate more closely to monitor cross-border flows linked to high-risk jurisdictions, ensuring that Pakistan’s reforms translate into measurable disruption rather than rhetorical reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: Choosing Substance Over Stability Theater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will argue that renewed scrutiny risks destabilizing a fragile state. That argument has been persuasive before, and it has failed before. Stability built on tolerated militancy is not stability at all; it is deferred risk. Western capitals should therefore anchor their engagement around two imperatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, international partners should move beyond accepting legislative reforms and instead condition high-level diplomatic, security, and economic engagement with Pakistan on verifiable enforcement outcomes. This means tying cooperation to demonstrable actions such as sustained terrorist-financing prosecutions, asset freezes against UN- and US-designated individuals, and the disruption of digital fundraising networks linked to groups like JeM and LeT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, Washington and Brussels should treat Pakistan-linked terrorist financing as a transnational financial integrity threat, not a regional security issue. This requires enhanced monitoring of fintech platforms, mobile wallets, charities, and micro-donation systems used by diaspora-linked networks in Europe and North America. FATF has repeatedly warned that terrorist groups increasingly exploit digital payments and new financial technologies to evade traditional controls. The EU and US should expand joint typology sharing, require higher due-diligence thresholds for transactions linked to high-risk jurisdictions, and protect activists and journalists targeted by&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/repression-without-borders-how-pakistan-silences-critics-overseas/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;transnational repression&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tied to Pakistan’s security apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Mexico City, Pakistan will speak in the language of compliance and reform. Beyond the conference halls, the true test will be whether the networks that finance violence are finally dismantled or quietly allowed to endure. If Western governments choose substance over symbolism, this moment can mark a turning point. If not, the paperwork will pass, and the risks will return—more adaptive, more opaque, and more dangerous than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>Russia is Targeting Civilians in Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-is-targeting-civilians-in-ukraine</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine &lt;a href=&quot;https://ukraine.ohchr.org/en/2025-deadliest-year-for-civilians-in-Ukraine-since-2022-UN-human-rights-monitors-find&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that 14,383 civilians were killed in Ukraine, 673 of them children, as of late 2025. Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine’s power grid, generating facilities, and heating infrastructure, in efforts to disrupt electricity, heat, and water services – especially in winter. Clearly, Russia is targeting Ukraine’s civilian population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, recently told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kyiv-has-only-half-electricity-it-needs-mayor-says-2026-01-16/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reuters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Kyiv, with a population of 3.6 million people, has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis, following waves of Russian attacks on its infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth year, Ukrainian casualties are estimated at around 400,000, with civilian casualties rising, according to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Laws of War are clear: intentionally targeting civilians is prohibited; civilians should never be the objective of an attack. Even more specifically, a combatant should avoid or reduce harm to civilian infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

These attacks are not isolated to the Kyiv, but, rather, part of a large, coordinated plan to target all regions in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has reported tens of thousands of energy infrastructure facilities have been damaged since 2022, damaging generation plants, substations, heating plants, and transmission lines. And at least 18 major combined heat and power plants have been destroyed or seriously damaged, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian strikes have left hundreds of thousands of people with no central heating during sub-zero weather, a widespread development throughout Ukraine. Indeed, officials and humanitarian groups are warning that millions of Ukrainians are at heightened risk this winter due to lack of heat, electricity, and water amid the intense cold. UN officials described the situation as a worsening humanitarian crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has systematically targeted civilian energy and heating infrastructure, not just military sites, with repeated missile and drone strikes aimed at power plants, grids, and heating systems, affecting thousands of facilities. The result is widespread blackouts and heating loss for civilians, especially during harsh &lt;a href=&quot;https://united24media.com/war-in-ukraine/weaponizing-winter-the-unrelenting-toll-of-russian-energy-strikes-on-kyivs-civilians-continues-15205&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;winter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with sub-zero temperatures, creating a serious humanitarian situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Putin’s strategy is to target civilians with the intensification of bombings against Ukraine’s infrastructure that provides heat, water, and electricity to the Ukrainian people. These are violations of the Laws of War, and the International Criminal Court should immediately commence with hearings on Russia’s indiscriminate bombing of civilian infrastructure, resulting in the death of thousands of Ukrainian civilians. Clearly, Mr. Putin is targeting Ukraine’s civilian population, a war crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph R.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The rise of the West is a simple story to tell culturally: It’s about Europe moving toward openness, cosmopolitanism, intellectual freedom, transparent rules, and, above all, institutional checks and balances. US President Donald Trump negates these values at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The killings of two innocent civilians –&amp;nbsp;both US citizens – by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis this month may mark a turning point for the United States. The energy and solidarity among people supporting their immigrant neighbors and protesting ICE’s brutal tactics herald a defining showdown.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The World Economic Forum chose “A Spirit of Dialogue” as the theme for this year’s meeting in Davos.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s interconnected global economy, tariffs produce outcomes that are very different from what traditional economic models would predict. Rather than causing only limited and temporary distortions, tariffs can generate persistent inflation, significant output losses, and damaging international spillovers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Loosening the Gordian Knot of Global Terrorism: Why Legitimacy Must Anchor a Counterterrorism Strategy</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/loosening-the-gordian-knot-of-global-terrorism-why-legitimacy-must-anchor-a-counterterrorism-strategy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; The global terrorism landscape in 2026 — the 25&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;anniversary year of the 9/11 terrorism attacks — is more uncertain, hybridized, and combustible than at any point since 9/11. Framing a sound U.S. counterterrorism strategy — especially in the second year of a Trump administration — will require more than isolated strikes against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/25/us/politics/trump-isis-nigeria-strike.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ISIS in Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, punitive counterterrorism operations in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2025/12/19/g-s1-103194/u-s-launches-strikes-syria&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, or a tougher rhetorical posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Trump administration counterterrorism strategy will require legitimacy: the domestic, international, and legal credibility that leverages a wide-range of counterterrorism tools, while engendering international counterterrorism cooperation. Without legitimacy, even tactically successful counterterrorism operations risk becoming illusory, politicized, and ultimately self-defeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The terrorist threat landscape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extremist violence no longer conforms to clean ideological lines. Terrorist objectives and drivers are muddled in ways that are hard to understand — but evolving. There’s little &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hstoday.us/featured/wray-lone-actors-purity-of-radical-ideology-giving-way-to-weird-hodgepodge-of-beliefs-behind-attacks/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ideological purity&lt;/a&gt; with those radicalizing in today’s extremist milieu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, state-directed intelligence officers increasingly behave like terrorists. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/15/world/europe/uk-mi6-russia-chaos.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Russian intelligence-linked&lt;/a&gt; sabotage plots blur the line between terrorism and hybrid warfare. Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers provide hands-on training to Lebanese Hizballah commanders. Addressing these kinds of risks requires legitimacy, too, especially among allies whose intelligence cooperation, legal authorities, and public support are indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is this threat picture more tenuous than in the Middle East. Hamas’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47828#:~:text=Summary,the%20Gaza%20Strip%20into%20Israel.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;October 7, 2023&lt;/a&gt;, attacks triggered a profound rebalancing of power in the region. Yet, Syria remains unfinished business. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/playing-the-role-of-good-shepherd-in-a-post-assad-syria&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Power vacuums&lt;/a&gt; there invite foreign jihadists, threaten Israel's border communities, and create future opportunities for Iranian influence to rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modest but persistent U.S. presence in Syria with a friendly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/syria-to-join-coalition-against-islamic-state-as-countrys-president-visits-trump-ed16328c&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ahmed al-Sharaa&lt;/a&gt;-led government remains a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/trump-administrations-counterterrorism-policy-should-begin-at-golan-heights&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;strategic hedge&lt;/a&gt; against an Islamic State resurgence, and is a strong signal of U.S. commitment that helps sustain partner confidence. The U.S. counterterrorism presence and alignment with al-Sharaa is not without its risks, though: in December, three Americans were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/world/middleeast/syria-us-soldiers-killed.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by a lone ISIS gunman in central Syria. The country is, and will continue to be, plagued by sectarianism and terrorism, which means that restoring control over a deeply fractured Syria remains fraught. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the current transnational terrorism threat landscape is volatile and difficult to predict, a challenge compounded by resource constraints. In such an environment, legitimacy becomes a force multiplier. A belief that America is a ‘force for good’, credible messaging, and confidence that U.S. government action is perceived as just, can go a long way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not an abstract concern. Terrorism today thrives in contested information environments, polarized societies, and fragile states. In short, transnational jihadist networks now coexist with domestic violent extremists, and online &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/islamic-states-caliphate-is-gone-its-influence-lives-on-7aed6cec&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;radicalization ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; that blur the line between terrorism, insurgency, and hybrid warfare. Terrorist propaganda continues to resonate with individuals in the West, especially younger generations who radicalize online. In this environment, legitimacy is no longer a secondary benefit of sound strategy—it is a core guiding principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trump administration's counterterrorism approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are looking for more clarity on the trajectory of Trump 2.0 counterterrorism efforts. It’s still, premature to consider a strategy that has yet to be formally articulated, as many in the counterterrorism community eagerly await its release. History offers a useful reminder. The first Trump administration did not publish its &lt;a href=&quot;https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NSCT.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Strategy for Counterterrorism&lt;/a&gt; until its second year. When it appeared in 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/10/trump-counterterrorism-strategy/572170/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;critics&lt;/a&gt; and supporters alike acknowledged that it reflected professional judgment rather than ideological excess. That document recognized terrorism’s evolution and called for strengthening counterterrorism partnerships within the U.S. government, but abroad as well, with a range of longstanding allies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What gave that strategy durability was its legitimacy. Authorities were grounded in law, threat assessments were evidence-based, policies were stress-tested for faulty assumptions, and foreign partnerships were treated as strategic assets rather than transactional relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Biden administration publicly released a set of redacted rules secretly issued by President Trump in 2017 for counterterrorism operations — such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/01/us/politics/trump-drone-strike-rules.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“direct action”&lt;/a&gt; strikes and special operations raids outside conventional war zones — those &lt;a href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/trump-psp-drone-strike-rules-foia/52f4a4baf5fc54c5/full.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; explicitly acknowledged the power of legitimacy. Counterterrorism succeeds when allies trust the U.S., and the American public believes force is used proportionately and lawfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That legacy of trust matters now more than ever, given signals that a second Trump administration could overcorrect on its counterterrorism priorities by redirecting and focusing resources on far-left extremist groups such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/us-news/justice-department-charges-four-in-alleged-new-years-eve-bomb-plot-37d38bb3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Turtle Island Liberation Front (TILF)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/18/justice-department-fbi-first-amendment-antifa/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Antifa&lt;/a&gt;, while downplaying far-right extremism—or being distracted from the more dangerous terrorism threats from ISIS and other violent jihadists. As the world recently witnessed during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/isis-syria-bondi-beach-attacks-christmas-11239979&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;holidays&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/31/world/australia/bondi-beach-attack-vigil-new-year-sydney.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bondi Beach&lt;/a&gt; to Syria, ISIS remains a threat. Far-Left terrorism in the U.S. is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/charlie-kirk-left-wing-terrorism/684323/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, but far-right terrorism accounts for greater lethality than did the left. And still, after 25 years, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-december-19/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ISIS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-global-state-of-al-qaida-24-years-after-9-11/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;al-Qa’ida&lt;/a&gt; that remain the most persistent and enduring transnational terrorism threat against U.S interests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trump National Security Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s concerning that the recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (NSS) only tepidly addresses &lt;a href=&quot;https://mwi.westpoint.edu/what-happened-to-transnational-terrorism/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transnational terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, but notably links terrorism with cross-border threats and hemispheric cooperation against things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/inside-trump-s-second-term-national-security-strategy?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“narco-terrorists,”&lt;/a&gt; blurring the traditional separation between transnational organized crime and terrorism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Trump administration’s emphasis on drug cartels is justifiable, if it does &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;detract from broader counterterrorism objectives, such as the ISIS or hybridizing terrorist threats that continue to emerge. Commentators claim, however, that the Trump administration is already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/22/terrorism-antifa-cartels-islamic-state-trump/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzY2NDY2MDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzY3ODQ4Mzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NjY0NjYwMDAsImp0aSI6IjBmZjlhNzVjLTY2ZTMtNGE5Ni1iYTE1LTVhMWI2ZjJhY2Y4ZiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDI1LzEyLzIyL3RlcnJvcmlzbS1hbnRpZmEtY2FydGVscy1pc2xhbWljLXN0YXRlLXRydW1wLyJ9.G3CUd5dUcejxMk6jlx5otj5FfSyAg8z_r0x4xmdUGvk&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;losing sight&lt;/a&gt; of the ISIS and al-Qa’ida threats, though settling that debate here is quixotic at best — only time will tell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides jihadi threats, the U.S. does not need the unintended consequences and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/us-intervention-against-mexican-cartels-carries-major-risks-heres-how-to-mitigate-them/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt; of triggering a cycle of cartel retaliation – or &lt;a href=&quot;https://icct.nl/publication/counter-terrorism-implications-second-trump-presidency&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;provoking greater far-left violence&lt;/a&gt; – down-the-line in the U.S. homeland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrastingly, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2017 National Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt; saw radical Islamist terrorism as one of the priority transnational threats that could undermine U.S. security and stability. The strategy highlighted groups such as ISIS and al-Qa’ida as continuing dangers, stressing that terrorists had taken control of parts of the Middle East and remained a threat globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

It also erodes trust between the government and the public and leads citizens to second-guess whether they are being told the truth or being led astray. The 2017 NSS carried weight precisely because it was grounded in intelligence, not politics. Moreover, the NSS helped frame the counterterrorism strategy that followed and proved highly effective in keeping Americans safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawing lessons from the 2018 National Strategy for Counterterrorism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3466967&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2018 National Strategy for Counterterrorism (NSCT)&lt;/a&gt; remains a useful foundation for the second Trump administration—not because the world is unchanged, but because it embraced balance. The strategy emphasized foreign partnerships, non-military tools, and targeted direct action when necessary. It recognized a central legitimacy principle: the United States cannot and should not fight every terrorist everywhere with American troops when capable counterterrorism partners can do so in their own backyards, with local consent, and a more granular understanding of the grievances that motivate these terrorist groups and their supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And still, U.S. counterterrorism pressure through direct action remains a necessary tool to disrupt terrorism planning. It seems that the second Trump Administration is following the playbook of the first Trump administration in terms of aggressive counterterrorism kinetic strikes in places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/trump-airstrikes-isis-somalia.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/us-attack-houthis.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yemen,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/14/middleeast/iraq-syria-isis-killed-intl-hnk/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/counterterrorism-drone-strikes.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rescinded Biden-era limits on counterterrorism drone strikes&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the kind of flexible operational framework used for counterterrorism throughout the President’s first term. Thus far, in the aggressive counter-narcotic campaign in international waters off Venezuela, the standoff U.S. strikes resemble &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/12/18/stephen-miller-boat-strikes-mexico-venezuela-execute-order/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;counterterrorism operations&lt;/a&gt; in Yemen and Somalia during the first Trump administration. Operationally, direct action remains an indispensable counterterrorism tool for disrupting terror groups overseas, and more U.S. direct action will likely be necessary in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/world/africa/africa-terrorism-trump-ivory-coast.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;West Africa and the Sahel&lt;/a&gt; to keep jihadist groups operating there off balance, forcing them to devote more time and resources to operational security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But pressure without legitimacy is counterproductive. What works against jihadist networks does not necessarily translate cleanly to drug cartels or transnational criminal gangs. So, policymakers must be circumspect that expanding the scope of counterterrorism authorities and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justsecurity.org/107770/cartels-foreign-terrorism-designation/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;terrorist designations&lt;/a&gt; to canvas drug cartels, risks the unintended consequences of triggering destabilizing cycles of violence in the future, and straining more traditional counterterrorism resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming full circle, in light of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/us/politics/trump-capture-maduro-venezuela.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro&lt;/a&gt; for narcoterrorism-related offenses, the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/opinion/venezuela-attack-trump-us.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;legitimacy&lt;/a&gt; will be fiercely debated in the days and weeks ahead. If the Trump National Security Strategy is the roadmap for focusing on narcoterrorism in the Western Hemisphere, then the need for publishing a clarifying and rational U.S. counterterrorism strategy for the rest of the world takes on even greater sense of urgency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing a boulder uphill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on past counterterrorism lessons to find a comprehensive strategy—from the Bush administration’s wartime footing, through 8 years of Obama counterterrorism work, to President Trump’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/26557430.pdf?refreqid=fastly-default%3A1faeef863e0ec72ac7818cd224ce47cf&amp;amp;ab_segments=&amp;amp;initiator=&amp;amp;acceptTC=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;war on terror&quot;&lt;/a&gt; — is a Sisyphean task. But, in the wake of over two decades of relentless overseas counterterrorism work, a few ideas have come into sharper focus:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After more than two decades of counterterrorism, loosening the Gordian knot of modern terrorism requires balance, far greater clarity, and consistent, predictable national leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, counterterrorism strategy requires legitimacy. Without it, counterterrorism becomes reactive and politicized. With it, a Trump 2.0 counterterrorism strategy can still be firm, flexible, and credible in a far more dangerous world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>Iran at the Breaking Point: How Afghanistan and Iraq Still Inform U.S. Strategy</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/iran-at-the-breaking-point-how-afghanistan-and-iraq-still-inform-u-s-strategy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT PERSPECTIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;Iran is experiencing its most consequential period of internal &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/toll-irans-protest-crackdown-reaches-5002-dead-trump-129476717&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;unrest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in years. Nationwide demonstrations driven by economic collapse, social grievance, and political frustration have been met with force, mass arrests, and near-total information control. The scale and coordination of the response suggest a regime that feels threatened but not unmoored, confident in its ability to absorb pressure while preventing fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This moment has reignited debate in Washington about escalation, leverage, and the possibility—explicit or implicit—of regime collapse. That debate is familiar. The United States has confronted similar moments before, most notably in Afghanistan and Iraq, where early assumptions about pressure, legitimacy, and endurance proved wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is not an argument for restraint or intervention. It is a warning drawn from experience: without understanding how competition unfolds below the level of open conflict - the gray zone - pressure alone does not produce favorable outcomes. Iran today sits at the center of a problem the United States has repeatedly misunderstood - not the use of force, but what comes before and after it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afghanistan and Iraq: Where Strategy Slipped&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan, the United States removed the Taliban from power quickly. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein’s regime collapsed even faster. In both cases, the decisive phase of the conflict ended early. What followed was the harder contest—one defined less by firepower and more by local power structures, informal authority, and external interference operating quietly and persistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan, as I witnessed firsthand, regional actors adapted faster than Washington. Iran, Pakistan, Russia, and later China treated the conflict as a long game. They invested in relationships, cultivated influence, and positioned themselves for the post-U.S. environment years before the withdrawal. The result was not an immediate defeat on the battlefield, but a strategic hollowing-out of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq followed a similar trajectory. Iranian-aligned militias embedded themselves within neighborhoods, religious institutions, and political parties. Over time, they became inseparable from the state itself. U.S. military dominance did not prevent this. In fact, it often obscured it, until the architecture of influence was already in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson from both cases is straightforward: control of territory is temporary; control of networks endures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iran Is Not Afghanistan or Iraq — But the Pattern Rhymes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran today is often discussed as if pressure will produce rapid political change. That assumption ignores how power is organized inside the Islamic Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran’s security model is deliberately social. The Basij is not simply a paramilitary &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/6238623/iran-basij-militia-meaning-mahsa-amini/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;force&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; it is embedded across society—universities, workplaces, neighborhoods, religious institutions. Its purpose is not only repression, but surveillance, mobilization, and ideological reinforcement. This structure was built to survive unrest, sanctions, and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Externally, Iran has exported the same logic. In Iraq, allied militias function simultaneously as armed actors, political movements, and social providers. In Afghanistan, Iran preserved influence across regime changes, maintaining access to key actors even after the fall of the Republic. These are not improvisations; they are the product of decades of learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth remembering that Iran was not a spectator during the U.S. presence in Afghanistan and Iraq. It observed American methods up close—what worked, what failed, and where patience outperformed power. Tehran adapted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Escalation Without Preparation Backfires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moments of internal unrest often create pressure for external action. Yet Afghanistan and Iraq show that collapse—real or perceived—creates its own risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing a regime does not dismantle informal power structures. It often accelerates their consolidation. Networks that survive pressure are the ones that define what comes next. Iran’s internal system is designed precisely for this kind of stress: decentralized, redundant, and socially embedded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a strategic paradox at play. External pressure can validate internal narratives of siege and foreign threat, strengthening coercive institutions rather than weakening them. Information controls, security mobilization, and proxy signaling are not reactions; they are rehearsed responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why simplistic comparisons—whether to Eastern Europe, Latin America, or past protest movements, are misleading. Iran’s political &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/iran-crumbling-revolutionary-facade-protests&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ecosystem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is closer to the environments the United States faced in Kabul and Baghdad than many in Washington are willing to admit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who’s Reading this? More than 500K of the most influential national security experts in the world. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;full access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; to what the Experts are reading?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this suggests that Iran is immune to pressure or that its current trajectory is stable. Economic distress, generational change, and legitimacy erosion are real. But history cautions against assuming that pressure equals control or that unrest equals opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more relevant question for U.S. policymakers is not whether Iran is vulnerable, but whether the United States is prepared to operate effectively in the space that follows vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That preparation requires understanding how authority is distributed beneath formal institutions, recognizing how coercive and social systems reinforce one another, and anticipating how regional actors adapt during periods of instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the same lessons Afghanistan and Iraq offered lessons learned too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran’s current unrest has reopened a familiar debate in Washington about pressure, leverage, and escalation. But Afghanistan and Iraq should have settled that debate long ago. The United States did not lose those conflicts because it lacked military power; it lost because it underestimated how authority, loyalty, and influence actually function inside contested societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran is not a blank slate, nor is it a fragile state waiting to collapse under external strain. It is a system built to absorb pressure, manage unrest, and outlast moments of crisis. Any approach that treats unrest as an opportunity without first understanding what follows it risks repeating the same strategic error the United States has already made—twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choice facing U.S. policymakers is therefore not whether to act, but how to act without misunderstanding the terrain. Escalation without preparation does not produce control; it produces consequences that others are better positioned to manage. If Washington has truly learned from Afghanistan and Iraq, it will recognize that the most dangerous moment is not the collapse of order, but the false confidence that comes before it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History will not judge the United States on whether it applied pressure. It will judge whether it understood what that pressure would unleash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>The Kremlin Files: Russia’s Way to the Gray Zone</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-kremlin-files-russias-way-to-the-gray-zone</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/two-men-in-a-serious-conversation-one-in-a-suit-the-other-in-a-military-uniform.jpg?id=63002583&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C44%2C0%2C44&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE KREMLIN FILES / COLUMN — &lt;/strong&gt;(Note: This is the first in a two-part &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-surveillance-state&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;series&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Russian gray zone, or hybrid warfare. In a future article, the author will address the continued evolution of Russian hybrid warfare and its practice in the years immediately leading up to and through Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian hybrid warfare, often referred to in the West as “gray zone” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/gray-zone-warfare&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conflict&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has transitioned from theoretical concept to prominent headlines, particularly following the invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin’s campaigns of sabotage, disinformation, and targeted intelligence actions across Europe and the U.S. What defines Russian-style gray warfare, or hybrid war? What are its doctrinal roots, and how well do these foundations align with assumptions in Western security discussions? To explore these questions, this article analyzes the writings of Russian military thinkers and the views of Russian military and intelligence agencies—covering their terminology, doctrines, and their evolving grasp of non-kinetic conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray zone operations in the West are generally seen as actions that influence the course of a conflict or harm an adversary without crossing into direct kinetic attacks. For Russia, at the core of the gray zone is the concept of “non-contact war” (&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;bezkontaktnaya voina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), which is part of a larger doctrinal framework under which gray warfare, also called “new generation warfare” by the Russians, falls. This is not a new concept in Russian military thinking, but it has developed over decades. By examining its evolution over the past thirty years through Russian sources and military thinkers, we can better understand how Moscow uses these concepts today—and how they influence the conflicts we may face now and in the future, enabling the U.S. and our allies to respond more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main components of Russian gray warfare. Russians rarely use the term hybrid war, which exists in Russian only as a borrowed term from English. The first concept is non-contact warfare—the concept of preparing and softening the battlefield, then minimizing ground engagements for their troops whenever possible. The second concept is Russian intelligence active measures, also known as measures of support. This is also an old idea in Russian intelligence circles, but one that has been expanded and intensified in recent decades, incorporating new elements such as cyber operations and cognitive warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will briefly discuss each of these concepts below, along with Russia’s gray-zone developments up to its deployments into Ukraine in 2014. In the second part of this series, we will analyze Russia’s doctrine as it was applied in the years immediately leading up to and through the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while also considering another key factor for Russia—their ability to evolve and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Contact Warfare: Origins and Russian Military Necessities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-contact warfare developed from what the Russian General Staff and other military thinkers called sixth-generation warfare. The concept grew from the “reconnaissance strike complex” theory and the so-called “revolution in military affairs” at the end of the Cold War. As the Soviet Union disintegrated and the U.S. demonstrated overwhelming air power with NATO and other allies during the Persian Gulf war, former Soviet and Russian generals were not fools. They understood they could not keep pace with the new advancements in air warfare and the technological edge of NATO weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian General Staff thinkers recognized that the Russian Air Force could not match TTPs (techniques, tactics, and procedures), the number of pilot training hours, or the advanced systems that the U.S. and NATO could field, especially given their significantly reduced military budget following the Soviet Union's collapse. This operational shortfall was further emphasized by the targeted bombing campaigns and overwhelming force deployed by U.S./NATO forces in the Balkan campaigns of the mid-1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

NATO airpower and the reach of the alliance into all sorts of regions and conflict zones posed a significant challenge for the Russian military and its intelligence services. One of the lessons they understood was that massed tank formations alone would not win wars in the 21st century. Throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s, several important writings were produced by prominent Russian general staff figures, such as Generals Slipchenko and Gareev, as well as the future Chief of Staff of the Russian military and currently the commander of the Russian forces in the Ukraine war, Valeriy Gerasimov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slipchenko is credited in Russia with coining the phrase “sixth generation warfare” more than twenty years ago. According to Slipchenko, this new form of warfare signified a shift from nuclear-based conflict (which he called “fifth generation”) toward information-enabled, precision-strike, so-called non-contact wars (he authored a book with that same title). These wars would be fought at a distance, relying on airpower, command, control, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (C4ISR), and long-range precision strikes, rather than large ground forces. He and Gareev published a book in Russia in 2004 titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Future Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which became influential in many Russian military circles. In this work, Slipchenko and Gareev emphasized the importance of studying non-contact warfare and firmly stated that Russia must adapt to it, or else “Russia would not survive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that same period, Russia’s Air Force struggled significantly in the 1990s and 2000s to adopt precision-guided munitions (PGMs). Russia never fully integrated them or appropriately trained them on their use, which was evident in its prolonged conflicts with Chechen separatists. Most ground-attack operations during that period, from the mid to late 1990s, relied on “dumb bombs” and massed artillery on the battlefield. This resulted in the Russian air force’s poor performance in the 2008 Georgian conflict, when an outmanned Georgian military embarrassingly shot down several Russian fighter-bombers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2008, responding to Georgia launching an incursion to retake South Ossetia, Russia responded with overwhelming force, sending an entire army to occupy swaths of Abkhazia, Ossetia, and also northern Georgia from Poti to Gori and the edges of Tbilisi. But while their force ratios led to quick success on the ground, the Russian air force did not perform as well in the air. In addition to air losses to ground-based air defense and friendly fire, Russian precision strikes did not go off as planned. Russia’s performance could be summed up as ineffective from the air. They were not able to project over-the-horizon warfare in the ways that Russian military planners had envisioned for non-contact war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first widespread and successful use of Russian PGMs would come still later, mostly during Russia’s involvement in Syria, where Russian squadrons were rotated for training and gained exposure to actual combat. Before that, many pilots had not experienced any combat outside of Chechnya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Air Force underwent a series of reforms due to these failures. It was reorganized and renamed the Russian Aerospace Forces (the VKS) in 2015 as a result of many of these reforms, or what were claimed to be reforms. When the full-scale invasion happened in 2022, Russia’s VKS, like much of its military, was still trying to evolve from its targeted reforms and these earlier developmental challenges. They attempted a limited shock-and-awe offensive but failed miserably in areas such as battle damage assessment and other key aspects of a true air campaign (the second article in this series will touch on these issues in more detail).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, military reforms and adaptations in the Russian Air Force were not meant to stand alone. Russian kinetic actions were intended to be supported by other elements in non-contact warfare, aimed at softening the battlefield and undermining an adversary’s ability to fight. Prominent among these were active measures focused on information operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active Measures, Measures of Support, and Non-state Actors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning to Russian arms doctrine, Slipchenko and other figures on the General Staff argued that, in the post–Cold War world, especially after observing the 1991 Gulf War and the dominance of US airpower, massing military forces was no longer effective. The world saw how Saddam’s large army, with thousands of tanks and armored vehicles, was destroyed from the air. Slipchenko claimed that future wars will focus on disrupting enemy systems, including military, economic, social, and other so-called “information means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was not a new concept for Russia and its intelligence agencies—the FSB, GRU, and SVR (collectively the Russian intelligence services or RIS). The RIS would play a key role by using a well-known Russian technique—active measures, or as the RIS calls them today, measures of support. These tactics aim to weaken the enemy's ability to fight through malign influence, political interference, and disinformation. The Russians use state agencies and means, like their intelligence services, but also so-called non-state actors, like organized crime, private mercenaries, hacker groups, and many others, to carry out these and other hybrid actions as proxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctrinal approach of gray war, or new generation warfare, was gaining attention in Russia just as Putin's reign started. His rule coincided with the growing influence of the RIS within the government. It was natural for the RIS to take on roles the military was not equipped to perform, and Putin was quick to authorize them. One of the first tests for their active measures and gray war was Russia’s brief war with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fpri.org/article/2025/03/russian-influence-operations-in-georgia-a-threat-to-democracy-and-regional-stability/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Georgia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2008. As noted above, and while their military’s performance was mixed, their intelligence services were very active in the information arena. Russia flooded international media with its version of events. Their still-growing “RTV” news network promoted stories of atrocities they claimed were committed by the Georgian military. Europe and the U.S. were caught off guard and unprepared by the conflict; there was little to no meaningful response to Russia’s military actions, and no high costs or reprisals. It was a lesson Russia would remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Georgia in 2008, while reforms were introduced in the air force in particular, the doctrinal debates continued. Building on Slipchenko’s ideas, writers from the General Staff, such as General Chekinov and General Bogdanov, further developed the doctrine they called “new-generation warfare.” Their work emphasized scripted roles in conflict for the information-psychological struggle, subversion, and cyber operations, while traditional large-scale combat operations became, by comparison, less prominent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the current Russian Chief of Staff,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/world/europe/russia-hybrid-war-gerasimov.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Valeriy Gerasimov, gave a speech in which he also advocated for a constant “second front” of information operations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against Russia’s enemies to weaken their ability to wage war. This speech and a later article became known in some circles in the West as the “Gerasimov doctrine,” although it was never officially called that in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerasimov’s speech and article focused on shifting Russia's attention to countering the so-called “color revolutions” that occurred in the first decade of this century in Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan. They were, and still are, viewed as a direct threat to Russia’s national security and to Putin’s dictatorship. Russia cannot tolerate functioning democracies and freedom on its borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining Gerasimov’s contributions with those of Slipchenko, Gareev, and others, the Russian military developed a concept of non-contact warfare that planned for long-range strikes executed after weakening the enemy through non-kinetic means. They de-emphasized large ground formations because, according to the theory, they should not be necessary. Russian measures of support are designed to weaken an adversary through disinformation, misinformation, malign influence on politics, and other methods. This would become the battle plan the Russians would attempt to implement in Ukraine in 2014 (and again, with adjustments, in 2022).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As cyber has taken a greater role in society and the mass media, the Russian grey zone approach has also increasingly included RIS cyber operations and online media manipulation to support “reflexive control,” an old Russian intelligence concept from the 1960s. The term reflects the notion of influencing an adversary to act in a desired way without the enemy’s awareness. Gerasimov and the military, along with leaders of the RIS, knew from Russia’s poor performance in Georgia that they were not ready for war with NATO or any strong peer-level adversary. They needed help to weaken any adversary with a capable armed force before actual war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syria and Ukraine would be the new testing grounds for this concept in practice, with a heavy reliance on the intelligence services to help prepare the battlefield before and through the military’s engagement. Their perceived successes in both theaters would, over time, convince the Russian intelligence services, its military, and most importantly, President Putin that Russia was ready for a much larger task— an attack on and seizure of the entire territory of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the US Government.
