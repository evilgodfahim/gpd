But their pseudo-intellectualism will never pass as the real thing, and while they may court the working class, it is financiers and tech billionaires whose interests they serve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new US National Security Strategy bears the cognitive signature of a movement that experiences demographic and cultural change as existential catastrophe. The goal is not merely to ignore real threats but to redefine the threat itself as the presence of people President Donald Trump calls “garbage.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By engaging in outcomes-based partnerships, governments can advance social-policy goals at half the cost, while paying only when targets have been achieved. Better yet, such initiatives can be scaled up massively, because they offer precisely the kind of opportunities that socially minded investors have been seeking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are five issues that any UK government must address in order to bring about a robust economic recovery, beginning with launching a process to rejoin the European single market or customs union. But rationalizing spending on the National Health Service, pensions, and welfare benefits will require considerably more courage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reaching climate neutrality by 2050 is non-negotiable, but it is impossible to know in 2025 the best way to get there. Rather than attempt to dictate the pathway now, EU policymakers must design a strategy that leaves space for unexpected innovations and adequately accounts for geopolitical risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to New Delhi should be a wake-up call for the United States: attempting to coerce India into actions that compromise its national interest is a recipe for estrangement. Given that India remains crucial to balance China’s aggressive rise, such an outcome would carry high costs for the US.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new US National Security Strategy represents a decisive departure from the universalist values that have guided US foreign policy since 1945. Its nativist, anti-liberal stance should dispel any remaining European illusions about the current state of the transatlantic alliance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The European Union cannot reduce its digital dependence by investing in infrastructure that leaves underlying power relationships intact. Real power comes from controlling the parts of the value chain that shape decision-making, govern data flows, and set the standards that structure digital markets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By ignoring the long-run effects of both government-funded and privately funded innovation, Britain's official budget scorer has been systematically underestimating the economy's potential output and the government's future fiscal headroom. The result is not fiscal discipline, but a costly illusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As governments weaken environmental protections to promote new mining projects, the global scramble for critical minerals is deepening social divides and harming vital ecosystems.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a world marked by volatility, no investment yields greater economic returns than supporting children in their first five or six years of life.

      <title>Why Peace in Ukraine Remains a Distant Prospect</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When two warring parties’ core objectives are fundamentally incompatible, no amount of external pressure or diplomacy can bridge the gap between them. Peace in Ukraine will come eventually, but it almost certainly will not come from US President Donald Trump's current diplomatic push, no matter how many deadlines he sets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Climate change is rapidly melting the glaciers that feed Central Asia’s rivers, pushing the region toward an ecological tipping point. Against this backdrop, a new initiative aims to revive a long-abandoned plan to redirect part of Siberia’s freshwater to its southern neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Japan’s new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, was not wrong when she recently said that the country must be prepared to defend itself even beyond its borders. But she would be in a stronger position to strengthen Japan’s military muscle if she were willing to reckon with her political forebears’ war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After attempting to impose draconian peace terms on Ukraine, the US delegation responsible for negotiating with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who all but dictated those terms, has once again failed to achieve a breakthrough. Even if the Trump administration does manage to get a peace agreement signed, what it contains – and what it omits – is likely to be a formula for renewed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By rejecting all four ballot measures in a recent referendum, Ecuadorian voters demonstrated an understanding that neither their right-wing president, Daniel Noboa, nor Donald Trump seems to share. Militarizing poor neighborhoods and inviting US troops is no way to resolve a security crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;China is widely expected to adopt a range of pronatalist policies in a bid to raise birth rates. But recent efforts to encourage women to have more babies will have short-lived effects, while coercive measures – such as bans on contraception and abortion – would trigger a public backlash and prove futile at best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even as aging populations leave the workforce and critical sectors scramble for talent, an anti-immigrant backlash is gathering force across much of the developed world.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even as China and the United States compete for scientific leadership, the Trump administration has slashed investment in research and tightened immigration rules.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Public procurement is one of the world’s most powerful yet underused industrial-policy tools.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Terrorists are once again targeting Nigeria’s schools, kidnapping more than 300 children in recent weeks. The international community must provide the Nigerian government with immediate surveillance support to secure the release of the abducted students, as well as long-term resources to help make the country’s schools safer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump’s Tariffs Are Hitting India Hard</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump’s punishing tariffs have laid bare the fragility of India’s export model, which depends on a handful of markets and a narrow band of relatively low-value-added products. Only by embracing a new model – which emphasizes diversification, regional cooperation, and value addition – can India build long-term resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;China has built the machinery of an innovative, low-carbon industrial economy capable of leading the global net-zero transition and the unfolding AI revolution.

      <title>Make Russia Pay for Its War on Ukraine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As many European leaders acknowledge, the United States has left Europe (including the United Kingdom and Norway) with no choice but to see to its own defense. Using frozen Russian assets to provide a Reparations Loan to Ukraine is a forceful step in this direction that Europeans could take without US involvement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Corruption Is the Point</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Donald Trump's use of the presidency to enrich himself is unprecedented in American history, it does have analogues in Russia and other former communist countries. In fact, by appointing incompetent subordinates who owe him everything, Trump recalls a tried-and-tested Stalinist practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Behind the facade of unity, global banking supervisors are split between fear of over-regulation and concern that easing rules invites a repeat of the 2007-09 financial crisis. With the US rethinking supervision and scaling back enforcement, its break from Basel III is becoming increasingly obvious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For now, and in the foreseeable future, fiscal adjustment is a political non-starter in the US, where the prospect of higher taxes or cuts to Social Security and Medicare is a surefire way to lose votes. But this is probably where the country is headed, though it may take a severe fiscal crisis to get there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As authoritarian leaders seek to delegitimize independent news and AI blurs the line between facts and falsehoods, journalists around the world are fighting to be heard above a rising tide of misinformation and propaganda. In this environment, news outlets must assert their independence through rigorous reporting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is facing an inequality crisis fueled by stagnant wages, eroding social protections, and the extreme concentration of wealth.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Ireland to Palestine, the 20th century’s partitions promised stability but delivered bloodshed, animosity, and ethnic cleansing. A new book traces how the breakup of the British Indian Empire unleashed a chain of upheavals that redefined South Asia and shaped the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the group's rotating presidency passing to the United States, many expect that Donald Trump’s presence at the helm will further reduce the effectiveness of a once-promising multilateral economic institution.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In music as in other artistic pursuits, the only true freedom lies in controlling the fruit of one’s creation. AI could amplify this freedom if we act now on behalf of human creators; but as matters stand, it seems well on its way to doing the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump’s Stab in the Back</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading like it was dictated by the Kremlin, the Trump administration's latest &quot;peace&quot; plan for Ukraine would have dire implications not only for that country, but also for Europe and the rest of the world. The message is simple and unmistakable: Now that it stands for nothing, the United States can easily be bought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thousands of infrastructure projects across the United States are mired in red tape, driving up prices and eroding Americans’ quality of life. The solution is not more technology or consultants, but rather rebuilding government capacity by hiring and retaining skilled engineers to manage projects efficiently and control costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Don't Let Trump Sell Out Ukraine</title>

      <description>US President Donald Trump’s Ukraine peace plan is a non-starter for anyone who believes in the rule of law and supports European security. As negotiators continue to revise the terms, Europe must make clear that it will support Ukraine in opposing any deal that rewards Russian aggression.</description>

      <description>Whatever changes Ukrainian negotiators manage to wrest out of US officials, there is no question that President Donald Trump’s peace plan represents a strategic defeat not only for Ukraine, but for all of Europe. Rather than blaming Trump, however, Europeans need to take responsibility for their role in creating this situation.</description>
