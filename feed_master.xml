      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading like it was dictated by the Kremlin, the Trump administration's latest &quot;peace&quot; plan for Ukraine would have dire implications not only for that country, but also for Europe and the rest of the world. The message is simple and unmistakable: Now that it stands for nothing, the United States can easily be bought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>US President Donald Trump’s Ukraine peace plan is a non-starter for anyone who believes in the rule of law and supports European security. As negotiators continue to revise the terms, Europe must make clear that it will support Ukraine in opposing any deal that rewards Russian aggression.</description>

      <description>Whatever changes Ukrainian negotiators manage to wrest out of US officials, there is no question that President Donald Trump’s peace plan represents a strategic defeat not only for Ukraine, but for all of Europe. Rather than blaming Trump, however, Europeans need to take responsibility for their role in creating this situation.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's ceasefire agreement in Gaza could be the first step toward peace, but only if it evolves into a full-fledged plan that recognizes and appreciates the decades-long Palestinian struggle and allows new Palestinian leaders to emerge.

      <title>Why the New Canadian-Swedish Partnership Matters</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recently signed strategic partnership between Canada and Sweden is a modest move with outsize geopolitical implications. Canada can begin to reduce its overreliance on the United States, Sweden can increase its influence and market share, and NATO will get a stronger northern flank that is less exposed to swings in US politics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One upside to geopolitical fragmentation is that the rules and systems that have long constrained Africa’s development and industrial policies are being eroded.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was revealed last week that Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump have been secretly negotiating a settlement to the war in Ukraine.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Convinced that nationalism belongs to the past, liberals have largely abandoned appeals to cultural identity, allowing far-right political entrepreneurs to fill the void. To counter exclusionary nationalism, liberals must craft a unifying creed that restores a sense of shared destiny.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For rudderless center-left parties, the debate around asylum and immigration should be seen not as a necessary evil, but as a political opportunity.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since World War II, liberal democracies have built and sustained their social contracts on three mutually reinforcing pillars: freedom, prosperity, and the rule of law. If Europe is to thrive in the 21st century and continue to serve as a model of democratic values, it must reinvigorate all three.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has inexplicably maintained high interest rates in a deflationary environment, which increases debt-service costs and suppresses economic activity. It must change course now, because austerity in the name of fiscal sustainability is self-defeating if it destroys the conditions for growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that Donald Trump's administration has explicitly rejected the international rules-based institutions and arrangements that America created after World War II, the very idea of an international order is no longer relevant.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea that Africa can finance the green transition while simultaneously spending huge sums on debt service is absurd.
