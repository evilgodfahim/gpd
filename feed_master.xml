      <title>They're Coming for Our Kids: How Extremists Target Children Online</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/they-re-coming-for-our-kids</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;  September is National Preparedness Month - when we check our emergency kits, review evacuation routes, and prepare for natural disasters. But this year, as I sat in conference rooms at the Eradicate Hate Global Summit in Pittsburgh, I couldn't stop thinking about a different kind of storm brewing in our communities. One that doesn't announce itself with weather alerts or sirens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It targets our children in their digital third spaces - Discord servers where they chat with friends, Instagram feeds where they scroll for hours, Reddit forums where they seek community, gaming platforms where they unwind, and the sprawling ecosystem of social media where teenagers spend most of their waking hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, teenagers accounted for up to two-thirds of ISIS-linked arrests in Europe, with children as young as 11 involved in recent terrorist plots. But Islamic extremists aren't the only ones hunting in these digital spaces. White supremacist groups, neo-Nazi organizations, and other far-right movements have turned every corner of the internet where young people gather into potential recruitment centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What unites these predators across the ideological spectrum isn't their beliefs - it's their understanding that vulnerable children make easy targets. And while they've perfected their hunting techniques, we've dismantled our defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department issued a call for proposals in July 2025 to fund programs preventing terrorists from recruiting young people online. One month later, they canceled the entire initiative due to funding cuts. The very expertise needed to design and manage such responses had been dismantled when my office - the Office of Countering Violent Extremism - was shuttered along with similar prevention teams across the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're watching the storm approach, and we're sending the meteorologists home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New Hunting Grounds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every platform where teenagers gather has become a recruitment center for extremist movements. Neo-Nazi groups use gaming chats to spread white supremacist messaging. Islamic extremists exploit social media algorithms to target vulnerable youth. Far-right militias recruit through conspiracy theory forums. Anti-government extremists find followers in survivalist communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tactics mirror those used by online predators - build trust, isolate targets, gradually introduce radical ideas, and exploit vulnerabilities. A teenager struggling with social isolation logs into Discord seeking connection and community. Instead, they find recruiters who validate their frustrations while slowly introducing conspiracy theories, hate-filled content, and calls for violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The progression is methodical. First comes the meme that seems edgy but harmless. Then the private message offering &quot;real truth&quot; about current events. Next, the invitation to a smaller, more exclusive group where radical content flows freely. Finally, the encouragement to take action—whether spreading propaganda, targeting individuals, or planning violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren't random encounters. Extremist recruiters study adolescent psychology, identifying kids who show signs of depression, social anxiety, or family conflict. They understand that teenagers are naturally questioning authority and seeking identity—normal developmental phases that can be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History's Warning Signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exploitation of youth isn't new - only the technology has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hitler Youth movement systematically recruited children through youth organizations. The Red Army Faction in 1970s Germany drew from disaffected university students. The Irish Republican Army found fertile recruiting ground among marginalized teenagers in Belfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these historical cases teach us is that extremist movements succeed when they fill voids left by failing institutions. When young people can't find meaning, purpose, or belonging through legitimate channels, they become vulnerable to those offering simple explanations for complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's digital environment amplifies these vulnerabilities exponentially. Where previous extremists recruited face-to-face in specific locations, online recruiters can reach millions simultaneously, test messaging in real-time, and operate across borders with minimal detection risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Programs We Dismantled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevention infrastructure dismantled over the past year wasn't theoretical—it was saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the State Department, our team worked with tech companies to identify recruitment tactics and develop content policies that protected legitimate speech while removing extremist material. We helped content moderators recognize subtle grooming techniques that avoid automated detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships at DHS built relationships with schools and community organizations to identify early warning signs. Their approach was therapeutic, not punitive—providing intervention resources that addressed underlying issues rather than criminalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the FBI, specialized teams tracked recruitment networks and distinguished between teenage edginess and genuine threats. The Department of Health and Human Services funded research into psychological vulnerabilities that informed prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All shared common principles: early intervention beats prosecution; community solutions work better than federal enforcement; understanding radicalization psychology is essential for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Disinformation Amplifier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes today's threat environment particularly dangerous is how disinformation amplifies extremist recruitment while major platforms fail to enforce their own policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I write this, Houthi-linked arms dealers openly sell weapons on verified X accounts, advertising Kalashnikovs and equipment marked &quot;Property of U.S. Govt.&quot; The Tech Transparency Project identified 130 Yemen-based accounts advertising weapons, some with verification checkmarks. X even ran advertisements beneath these posts, generating revenue from terrorist-linked content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A teenager exposed to election fraud conspiracies becomes more susceptible to political violence messaging. Young people fed disinformation about minority communities become easier targets for white supremacist recruitment. Disinformation serves as a gateway drug to radicalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It’s never been more important to understand what’s happening in the world. Upgrade your access to exclusive content by &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;becoming a subscriber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cost of Inaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Pittsburgh summit, I heard from parents whose children had been radicalized online, officers investigating cases without prevention resources, and community leaders watching young people disappear into digital hate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One mother found extremist content on her 14-year-old son's computer. When she sought help, local resources that might have provided intervention had lost federal funding. A police officer described investigating a high school attack plot that might have been prevented if early warning systems remained operational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These costs are measured in broken families, traumatized communities, and young lives destroyed by preventable radicalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Preparedness Really Means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't wait for hurricanes before planning—we build early warning systems and maintain emergency capabilities. The same logic should apply to extremist recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need systems detecting concerning behavioral changes before they become threats. We need intervention addressing psychological vulnerabilities before recruiters exploit them. We need community responses providing support when families encounter these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news: we know what works. Community-based prevention programs have demonstrated success in interrupting radicalization. EXIT programs in Germany and Sweden help individuals leave extremist groups through mentorship and psychological support. The Against Violent Extremism network connects former extremists with at-risk youth. Montreal's Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence has successfully intervened in over 1,000 cases through family counseling and community partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Path Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding prevention infrastructure requires immediate action and long-term commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress must restore funding for prevention programs at State, DHS, FBI, and HHS. These aren't luxury programs—they're essential public safety capabilities protecting vulnerable citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must rebuild scattered expertise by bringing prevention professionals back from think tanks, universities, and private companies through sustained investment commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need stronger partnerships between agencies, tech companies, schools, and communities. Prevention works best at multiple levels simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents and educators need training to recognize early warning signs. This means providing basic digital literacy and threat awareness to identify concerning behavioral changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need counter-messaging strategies competing with extremist propaganda for young people's attention—empowering communities to tell better stories about identity, purpose, and belonging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Field Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention vs. Reaction:&lt;/strong&gt; Preventing one radicalized individual costs approximately $30,000. Investigating, prosecuting, and incarcerating them after violence costs over $3 million—not counting human costs to victims and communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; The most effective programs work through trusted institutions—schools, religious organizations, sports teams, youth groups. Federal resources can support but can't replace local relationships and trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reader Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Your Circle:&lt;/strong&gt; Talk with young people about their online experiences—not to interrogate, but to understand their digital worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Local Programs:&lt;/strong&gt; Find prevention resources in your community. School counselors and youth organizations often spot concerning trends before law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice Digital Hygiene:&lt;/strong&gt; Model good information consumption. Fact-check claims before sharing them. Ask questions about sources when your teen shows you &quot;shocking&quot; content. Demonstrate critical thinking by saying &quot;That sounds concerning—let's look up where this information comes from&quot; rather than immediately reacting emotionally. Young people learn more from observation than instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I flew home from Pittsburgh, I thought about my children and their digital world. The threats they face aren't visible from satellites or predictable through models. They emerge from the intersection of human psychology and technology in ways we're only beginning to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But September's preparedness lessons still apply: early warning, community response, and sustained vigilance. The storms targeting our children won't announce themselves with sirens, but they can be detected, understood, and prevented—if we're willing to invest in the tools and expertise necessary to protect what matters most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cipher Brief Expert Dexter Ingram also publishes on Substack &lt;a href=&quot;https://dexteringram.substack.com/p/ive-tracked-terrorist-networks-for?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Code Name: Citizen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/dec/23/pope-leos-world-day-peace-opportunity-put-words-action/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Next FATF Test: Can the West Demand Results from Pakistan?</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-next-fatf-test-can-the-west-demand-results-from-pakistan</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;In the shadow of Mexico City's historic Palacio de Bellas Artes, global financial watchdogs will convene in February 2026 for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Plenary and Working Group Meetings. In conference rooms far removed from South Asia’s violence, Pakistan will once again present itself as a responsible counterterrorism partner, armed with compliance reports, legislative amendments, and assurances of reform. On paper, Pakistan’s financial regulations increasingly resemble those of many developing democracies. On the ground, however, the networks that finance and enable terrorism continue to adapt and operate with troubling resilience. The widening gap between form and function is precisely what Western policymakers must confront as FATF prepares its next round of assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Compliance Illusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s removal from the FATF grey list in 2022 was widely portrayed as a&lt;a href=&quot;https://mofa.gov.pk/pakistan-exits-fatfs-grey-list&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;success story&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Officials pointed to new anti-money laundering laws, terrorist financing prosecutions, and institutional reforms as evidence of a course correction. FATF itself&lt;a href=&quot;http://fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Mutualevaluations/Fur-pakistan-2022.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;acknowledged&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; technical improvements, yet it also emphasized that effectiveness, not legislation, remains the ultimate benchmark. That distinction has proven critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open-source reporting and documented financial intelligence patterns suggest that terrorist organizations such as Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) have not been dismantled but rather modernized.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-pakistan-backed-lashkar-e-taiba-jaish-e-mohammad-s-new-tactics-for-anti-india-activities-exploiting-gaza-war-for-terror-financing-recruiting-3196528&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Recent documents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveal how these UN-designated outfits exploit humanitarian crises, such as the Gaza conflict, to funnel funds into terror activities. Under the guise of aid appeals and mosque reconstructions, figures like Hammad Azhar, son of JeM leader Masood Azhar, and Azhar’s brother Talha al-Saif orchestrate campaigns&lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/pakistan-based-jem-launches-rs-3-91-billion-fundraising-drive-after-losses-during-operation-sindoor/articleshow/123434708.cms?from=mdr&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;using digital wallets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like EasyPaisa, SadaPay, and JazzCash, aggregating micro-donations and cryptocurrencies to evade detection. These efforts aggregate micro-donations and cryptocurrency transfers, often employing fragmented wallet structures and chain-hopping across platforms to avoid detection. Funds have&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/months-after-operation-sindoor-setback-pak-terror-outfit-jaish-raises-funds-to-rebuild-2774256-2025-08-20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;reportedly supported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; militant infrastructure, including the establishment of more than 300 Mosques and the reconstruction of locations historically linked to LeT training facilities damaged during India’s 2025 Operation Sindoor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern reflects more than opportunism. Pakistan’s legal framework may align with FATF’s 40 recommendations on paper, but operational enforcement remains deeply inconsistent. Sanctioned individuals such as Hafiz Talha Saeed have&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/hafiz-saeed-son-talha-saeed-lahore-rally-pm-modi-pahalgam-terror-attack-india-pak-tensions-2720626-2025-05-06&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;led public rallies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Lahore under police protection, issuing threats against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In 2025, senior Pakistani legislature Rana Muhammad Qasim Noon&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/India/pak-rebuilding-muzaffarabad-terror-camp-destroyed-in-operation-sindoor-minister-visits-site/ar-AA1PHdR0?cvid=6908a8eda8264964b07b806b1720fa36&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;reportedly visited&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; militant-affiliated reconstruction sites alongside local officials, revealing overt collaboration between state and non-state actors. Recruitment drives&lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-operation-sindoor-major-pakistan-terror-groups-shifting-base-to-afghanistan-border/articleshow/124008707.cms&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;disguised as religious gatherings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, often coordinated with Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam networks, have featured speeches praising Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, delivered by JeM commander Masood Ilyas Kashmiri at facilities such as Markaz Shohada-e-Islam in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these cases point to a long-standing “management” model of extremism. Militant groups are not dismantled but rebranded, with political fronts such as&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-party-face-of-mumbai-attacks-mastermind-hafiz-saeeds-banned-group-to-participate-in-pakistan-general-election/article67812218.ece&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contesting elections while violence is normalized as a political instrument. As Greece-based policy analyst Dimitra Staikou has&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.europawire.eu/pakistan-when-the-state-does-not-fight-terrorism-but-manages-it/eu-press-release/2026/01/09/15/48/56/167603/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;argued&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this model exports instability through regional alignments and shields militancy behind formal democratic processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Militant violence has&lt;a href=&quot;https://crss.pk/three-quarters-of-2025-nearly-as-violent-as-entire-2024/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;surged significantly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, driven by attacks from the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan and Baloch insurgent groups. Rather than prompting a clean break with all forms of militancy, this instability risks reinforcing the proxy logic that FATF scrutiny is meant to dismantle. For Western policymakers, the danger lies in conflating cooperation with convergence in security priorities. Intelligence sharing, access agreements, or economic partnerships do not necessarily reflect aligned counterterrorism priorities. As I&lt;a href=&quot;https://millichronicle.com/2025/10/58400.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;argued previously&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Milli Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Pakistan’s strategic incentives continue to reward selective tolerance of militant actors, particularly those oriented toward India. FATF’s effectiveness framework exists to test whether states are willing to disrupt these incentives, not simply mask them with procedural compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FATF’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/comprehensive-update-terrorist-financing-risks-2025.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;2025 Comprehensive Update&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Terrorist Financing Risks underscores the urgency. The report highlights a marked increase in hybrid digital methods, consistent with Pakistan-linked entities shifting from banks to fintech platforms to evade oversight. Although Pakistan exited the grey list in 2022 after four years of economic strain, FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aninews.in/news/world/europe/exit-from-greylist-not-bulletproof-fatf-warns-pakistan-against-terror-financing20251025044030/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;warned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October 2025 that the removal was “not bulletproof,” citing unregulated digital transactions as a continuing vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico City should therefore serve as a turning point. US and EU delegations should press for outcome-based evaluations focused on sustained investigations, verifiable asset seizures, and the dismantling of facilitation networks. Particular scrutiny must be directed toward digital payment systems, informal charities, and micro-donation models that exploit regulatory blind spots. Western governments should also coordinate more closely to monitor cross-border flows linked to high-risk jurisdictions, ensuring that Pakistan’s reforms translate into measurable disruption rather than rhetorical reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: Choosing Substance Over Stability Theater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will argue that renewed scrutiny risks destabilizing a fragile state. That argument has been persuasive before, and it has failed before. Stability built on tolerated militancy is not stability at all; it is deferred risk. Western capitals should therefore anchor their engagement around two imperatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, international partners should move beyond accepting legislative reforms and instead condition high-level diplomatic, security, and economic engagement with Pakistan on verifiable enforcement outcomes. This means tying cooperation to demonstrable actions such as sustained terrorist-financing prosecutions, asset freezes against UN- and US-designated individuals, and the disruption of digital fundraising networks linked to groups like JeM and LeT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, Washington and Brussels should treat Pakistan-linked terrorist financing as a transnational financial integrity threat, not a regional security issue. This requires enhanced monitoring of fintech platforms, mobile wallets, charities, and micro-donation systems used by diaspora-linked networks in Europe and North America. FATF has repeatedly warned that terrorist groups increasingly exploit digital payments and new financial technologies to evade traditional controls. The EU and US should expand joint typology sharing, require higher due-diligence thresholds for transactions linked to high-risk jurisdictions, and protect activists and journalists targeted by&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/repression-without-borders-how-pakistan-silences-critics-overseas/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;transnational repression&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tied to Pakistan’s security apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Mexico City, Pakistan will speak in the language of compliance and reform. Beyond the conference halls, the true test will be whether the networks that finance violence are finally dismantled or quietly allowed to endure. If Western governments choose substance over symbolism, this moment can mark a turning point. If not, the paperwork will pass, and the risks will return—more adaptive, more opaque, and more dangerous than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>Russia is Targeting Civilians in Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-is-targeting-civilians-in-ukraine</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine &lt;a href=&quot;https://ukraine.ohchr.org/en/2025-deadliest-year-for-civilians-in-Ukraine-since-2022-UN-human-rights-monitors-find&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that 14,383 civilians were killed in Ukraine, 673 of them children, as of late 2025. Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine’s power grid, generating facilities, and heating infrastructure, in efforts to disrupt electricity, heat, and water services – especially in winter. Clearly, Russia is targeting Ukraine’s civilian population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, recently told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kyiv-has-only-half-electricity-it-needs-mayor-says-2026-01-16/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reuters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Kyiv, with a population of 3.6 million people, has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis, following waves of Russian attacks on its infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth year, Ukrainian casualties are estimated at around 400,000, with civilian casualties rising, according to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Laws of War are clear: intentionally targeting civilians is prohibited; civilians should never be the objective of an attack. Even more specifically, a combatant should avoid or reduce harm to civilian infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

These attacks are not isolated to the Kyiv, but, rather, part of a large, coordinated plan to target all regions in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has reported tens of thousands of energy infrastructure facilities have been damaged since 2022, damaging generation plants, substations, heating plants, and transmission lines. And at least 18 major combined heat and power plants have been destroyed or seriously damaged, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian strikes have left hundreds of thousands of people with no central heating during sub-zero weather, a widespread development throughout Ukraine. Indeed, officials and humanitarian groups are warning that millions of Ukrainians are at heightened risk this winter due to lack of heat, electricity, and water amid the intense cold. UN officials described the situation as a worsening humanitarian crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has systematically targeted civilian energy and heating infrastructure, not just military sites, with repeated missile and drone strikes aimed at power plants, grids, and heating systems, affecting thousands of facilities. The result is widespread blackouts and heating loss for civilians, especially during harsh &lt;a href=&quot;https://united24media.com/war-in-ukraine/weaponizing-winter-the-unrelenting-toll-of-russian-energy-strikes-on-kyivs-civilians-continues-15205&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;winter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with sub-zero temperatures, creating a serious humanitarian situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Putin’s strategy is to target civilians with the intensification of bombings against Ukraine’s infrastructure that provides heat, water, and electricity to the Ukrainian people. These are violations of the Laws of War, and the International Criminal Court should immediately commence with hearings on Russia’s indiscriminate bombing of civilian infrastructure, resulting in the death of thousands of Ukrainian civilians. Clearly, Mr. Putin is targeting Ukraine’s civilian population, a war crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph R.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The rise of the West is a simple story to tell culturally: It’s about Europe moving toward openness, cosmopolitanism, intellectual freedom, transparent rules, and, above all, institutional checks and balances.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The World Economic Forum chose “A Spirit of Dialogue” as the theme for this year’s meeting in Davos.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s interconnected global economy, tariffs produce outcomes that are very different from what traditional economic models would predict.

      <title>Loosening the Gordian Knot of Global Terrorism: Why Legitimacy Must Anchor a Counterterrorism Strategy</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/loosening-the-gordian-knot-of-global-terrorism-why-legitimacy-must-anchor-a-counterterrorism-strategy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; The global terrorism landscape in 2026 — the 25&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;anniversary year of the 9/11 terrorism attacks — is more uncertain, hybridized, and combustible than at any point since 9/11. Framing a sound U.S. counterterrorism strategy — especially in the second year of a Trump administration — will require more than isolated strikes against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/25/us/politics/trump-isis-nigeria-strike.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ISIS in Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, punitive counterterrorism operations in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2025/12/19/g-s1-103194/u-s-launches-strikes-syria&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, or a tougher rhetorical posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Trump administration counterterrorism strategy will require legitimacy: the domestic, international, and legal credibility that leverages a wide-range of counterterrorism tools, while engendering international counterterrorism cooperation. Without legitimacy, even tactically successful counterterrorism operations risk becoming illusory, politicized, and ultimately self-defeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The terrorist threat landscape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extremist violence no longer conforms to clean ideological lines. Terrorist objectives and drivers are muddled in ways that are hard to understand — but evolving. There’s little &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hstoday.us/featured/wray-lone-actors-purity-of-radical-ideology-giving-way-to-weird-hodgepodge-of-beliefs-behind-attacks/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ideological purity&lt;/a&gt; with those radicalizing in today’s extremist milieu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, state-directed intelligence officers increasingly behave like terrorists. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/15/world/europe/uk-mi6-russia-chaos.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Russian intelligence-linked&lt;/a&gt; sabotage plots blur the line between terrorism and hybrid warfare. Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers provide hands-on training to Lebanese Hizballah commanders. Addressing these kinds of risks requires legitimacy, too, especially among allies whose intelligence cooperation, legal authorities, and public support are indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is this threat picture more tenuous than in the Middle East. Hamas’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47828#:~:text=Summary,the%20Gaza%20Strip%20into%20Israel.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;October 7, 2023&lt;/a&gt;, attacks triggered a profound rebalancing of power in the region. Yet, Syria remains unfinished business. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/playing-the-role-of-good-shepherd-in-a-post-assad-syria&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Power vacuums&lt;/a&gt; there invite foreign jihadists, threaten Israel's border communities, and create future opportunities for Iranian influence to rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modest but persistent U.S. presence in Syria with a friendly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/syria-to-join-coalition-against-islamic-state-as-countrys-president-visits-trump-ed16328c&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ahmed al-Sharaa&lt;/a&gt;-led government remains a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/trump-administrations-counterterrorism-policy-should-begin-at-golan-heights&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;strategic hedge&lt;/a&gt; against an Islamic State resurgence, and is a strong signal of U.S. commitment that helps sustain partner confidence. The U.S. counterterrorism presence and alignment with al-Sharaa is not without its risks, though: in December, three Americans were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/world/middleeast/syria-us-soldiers-killed.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by a lone ISIS gunman in central Syria. The country is, and will continue to be, plagued by sectarianism and terrorism, which means that restoring control over a deeply fractured Syria remains fraught. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the current transnational terrorism threat landscape is volatile and difficult to predict, a challenge compounded by resource constraints. In such an environment, legitimacy becomes a force multiplier. A belief that America is a ‘force for good’, credible messaging, and confidence that U.S. government action is perceived as just, can go a long way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not an abstract concern. Terrorism today thrives in contested information environments, polarized societies, and fragile states. In short, transnational jihadist networks now coexist with domestic violent extremists, and online &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/islamic-states-caliphate-is-gone-its-influence-lives-on-7aed6cec&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;radicalization ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; that blur the line between terrorism, insurgency, and hybrid warfare. Terrorist propaganda continues to resonate with individuals in the West, especially younger generations who radicalize online. In this environment, legitimacy is no longer a secondary benefit of sound strategy—it is a core guiding principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trump administration's counterterrorism approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are looking for more clarity on the trajectory of Trump 2.0 counterterrorism efforts. It’s still, premature to consider a strategy that has yet to be formally articulated, as many in the counterterrorism community eagerly await its release. History offers a useful reminder. The first Trump administration did not publish its &lt;a href=&quot;https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NSCT.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Strategy for Counterterrorism&lt;/a&gt; until its second year. When it appeared in 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/10/trump-counterterrorism-strategy/572170/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;critics&lt;/a&gt; and supporters alike acknowledged that it reflected professional judgment rather than ideological excess. That document recognized terrorism’s evolution and called for strengthening counterterrorism partnerships within the U.S. government, but abroad as well, with a range of longstanding allies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What gave that strategy durability was its legitimacy. Authorities were grounded in law, threat assessments were evidence-based, policies were stress-tested for faulty assumptions, and foreign partnerships were treated as strategic assets rather than transactional relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Biden administration publicly released a set of redacted rules secretly issued by President Trump in 2017 for counterterrorism operations — such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/01/us/politics/trump-drone-strike-rules.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“direct action”&lt;/a&gt; strikes and special operations raids outside conventional war zones — those &lt;a href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/trump-psp-drone-strike-rules-foia/52f4a4baf5fc54c5/full.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; explicitly acknowledged the power of legitimacy. Counterterrorism succeeds when allies trust the U.S., and the American public believes force is used proportionately and lawfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That legacy of trust matters now more than ever, given signals that a second Trump administration could overcorrect on its counterterrorism priorities by redirecting and focusing resources on far-left extremist groups such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/us-news/justice-department-charges-four-in-alleged-new-years-eve-bomb-plot-37d38bb3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Turtle Island Liberation Front (TILF)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/18/justice-department-fbi-first-amendment-antifa/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Antifa&lt;/a&gt;, while downplaying far-right extremism—or being distracted from the more dangerous terrorism threats from ISIS and other violent jihadists. As the world recently witnessed during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/isis-syria-bondi-beach-attacks-christmas-11239979&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;holidays&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/31/world/australia/bondi-beach-attack-vigil-new-year-sydney.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bondi Beach&lt;/a&gt; to Syria, ISIS remains a threat. Far-Left terrorism in the U.S. is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/charlie-kirk-left-wing-terrorism/684323/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, but far-right terrorism accounts for greater lethality than did the left. And still, after 25 years, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-december-19/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ISIS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-global-state-of-al-qaida-24-years-after-9-11/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;al-Qa’ida&lt;/a&gt; that remain the most persistent and enduring transnational terrorism threat against U.S interests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trump National Security Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s concerning that the recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (NSS) only tepidly addresses &lt;a href=&quot;https://mwi.westpoint.edu/what-happened-to-transnational-terrorism/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transnational terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, but notably links terrorism with cross-border threats and hemispheric cooperation against things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/inside-trump-s-second-term-national-security-strategy?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“narco-terrorists,”&lt;/a&gt; blurring the traditional separation between transnational organized crime and terrorism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Trump administration’s emphasis on drug cartels is justifiable, if it does &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;detract from broader counterterrorism objectives, such as the ISIS or hybridizing terrorist threats that continue to emerge. Commentators claim, however, that the Trump administration is already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/22/terrorism-antifa-cartels-islamic-state-trump/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzY2NDY2MDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzY3ODQ4Mzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NjY0NjYwMDAsImp0aSI6IjBmZjlhNzVjLTY2ZTMtNGE5Ni1iYTE1LTVhMWI2ZjJhY2Y4ZiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDI1LzEyLzIyL3RlcnJvcmlzbS1hbnRpZmEtY2FydGVscy1pc2xhbWljLXN0YXRlLXRydW1wLyJ9.G3CUd5dUcejxMk6jlx5otj5FfSyAg8z_r0x4xmdUGvk&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;losing sight&lt;/a&gt; of the ISIS and al-Qa’ida threats, though settling that debate here is quixotic at best — only time will tell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides jihadi threats, the U.S. does not need the unintended consequences and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/us-intervention-against-mexican-cartels-carries-major-risks-heres-how-to-mitigate-them/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt; of triggering a cycle of cartel retaliation – or &lt;a href=&quot;https://icct.nl/publication/counter-terrorism-implications-second-trump-presidency&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;provoking greater far-left violence&lt;/a&gt; – down-the-line in the U.S. homeland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrastingly, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2017 National Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt; saw radical Islamist terrorism as one of the priority transnational threats that could undermine U.S. security and stability. The strategy highlighted groups such as ISIS and al-Qa’ida as continuing dangers, stressing that terrorists had taken control of parts of the Middle East and remained a threat globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

It also erodes trust between the government and the public and leads citizens to second-guess whether they are being told the truth or being led astray. The 2017 NSS carried weight precisely because it was grounded in intelligence, not politics. Moreover, the NSS helped frame the counterterrorism strategy that followed and proved highly effective in keeping Americans safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawing lessons from the 2018 National Strategy for Counterterrorism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3466967&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2018 National Strategy for Counterterrorism (NSCT)&lt;/a&gt; remains a useful foundation for the second Trump administration—not because the world is unchanged, but because it embraced balance. The strategy emphasized foreign partnerships, non-military tools, and targeted direct action when necessary. It recognized a central legitimacy principle: the United States cannot and should not fight every terrorist everywhere with American troops when capable counterterrorism partners can do so in their own backyards, with local consent, and a more granular understanding of the grievances that motivate these terrorist groups and their supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And still, U.S. counterterrorism pressure through direct action remains a necessary tool to disrupt terrorism planning. It seems that the second Trump Administration is following the playbook of the first Trump administration in terms of aggressive counterterrorism kinetic strikes in places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/trump-airstrikes-isis-somalia.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/us-attack-houthis.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yemen,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/14/middleeast/iraq-syria-isis-killed-intl-hnk/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/counterterrorism-drone-strikes.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rescinded Biden-era limits on counterterrorism drone strikes&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the kind of flexible operational framework used for counterterrorism throughout the President’s first term. Thus far, in the aggressive counter-narcotic campaign in international waters off Venezuela, the standoff U.S. strikes resemble &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/12/18/stephen-miller-boat-strikes-mexico-venezuela-execute-order/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;counterterrorism operations&lt;/a&gt; in Yemen and Somalia during the first Trump administration. Operationally, direct action remains an indispensable counterterrorism tool for disrupting terror groups overseas, and more U.S. direct action will likely be necessary in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/world/africa/africa-terrorism-trump-ivory-coast.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;West Africa and the Sahel&lt;/a&gt; to keep jihadist groups operating there off balance, forcing them to devote more time and resources to operational security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But pressure without legitimacy is counterproductive. What works against jihadist networks does not necessarily translate cleanly to drug cartels or transnational criminal gangs. So, policymakers must be circumspect that expanding the scope of counterterrorism authorities and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justsecurity.org/107770/cartels-foreign-terrorism-designation/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;terrorist designations&lt;/a&gt; to canvas drug cartels, risks the unintended consequences of triggering destabilizing cycles of violence in the future, and straining more traditional counterterrorism resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming full circle, in light of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/us/politics/trump-capture-maduro-venezuela.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro&lt;/a&gt; for narcoterrorism-related offenses, the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/opinion/venezuela-attack-trump-us.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;legitimacy&lt;/a&gt; will be fiercely debated in the days and weeks ahead. If the Trump National Security Strategy is the roadmap for focusing on narcoterrorism in the Western Hemisphere, then the need for publishing a clarifying and rational U.S. counterterrorism strategy for the rest of the world takes on even greater sense of urgency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing a boulder uphill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on past counterterrorism lessons to find a comprehensive strategy—from the Bush administration’s wartime footing, through 8 years of Obama counterterrorism work, to President Trump’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/26557430.pdf?refreqid=fastly-default%3A1faeef863e0ec72ac7818cd224ce47cf&amp;amp;ab_segments=&amp;amp;initiator=&amp;amp;acceptTC=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;war on terror&quot;&lt;/a&gt; — is a Sisyphean task. But, in the wake of over two decades of relentless overseas counterterrorism work, a few ideas have come into sharper focus:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After more than two decades of counterterrorism, loosening the Gordian knot of modern terrorism requires balance, far greater clarity, and consistent, predictable national leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, counterterrorism strategy requires legitimacy. Without it, counterterrorism becomes reactive and politicized. With it, a Trump 2.0 counterterrorism strategy can still be firm, flexible, and credible in a far more dangerous world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>Iran at the Breaking Point: How Afghanistan and Iraq Still Inform U.S. Strategy</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/iran-at-the-breaking-point-how-afghanistan-and-iraq-still-inform-u-s-strategy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT PERSPECTIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;Iran is experiencing its most consequential period of internal &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/toll-irans-protest-crackdown-reaches-5002-dead-trump-129476717&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;unrest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in years. Nationwide demonstrations driven by economic collapse, social grievance, and political frustration have been met with force, mass arrests, and near-total information control. The scale and coordination of the response suggest a regime that feels threatened but not unmoored, confident in its ability to absorb pressure while preventing fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This moment has reignited debate in Washington about escalation, leverage, and the possibility—explicit or implicit—of regime collapse. That debate is familiar. The United States has confronted similar moments before, most notably in Afghanistan and Iraq, where early assumptions about pressure, legitimacy, and endurance proved wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is not an argument for restraint or intervention. It is a warning drawn from experience: without understanding how competition unfolds below the level of open conflict - the gray zone - pressure alone does not produce favorable outcomes. Iran today sits at the center of a problem the United States has repeatedly misunderstood - not the use of force, but what comes before and after it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afghanistan and Iraq: Where Strategy Slipped&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan, the United States removed the Taliban from power quickly. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein’s regime collapsed even faster. In both cases, the decisive phase of the conflict ended early. What followed was the harder contest—one defined less by firepower and more by local power structures, informal authority, and external interference operating quietly and persistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan, as I witnessed firsthand, regional actors adapted faster than Washington. Iran, Pakistan, Russia, and later China treated the conflict as a long game. They invested in relationships, cultivated influence, and positioned themselves for the post-U.S. environment years before the withdrawal. The result was not an immediate defeat on the battlefield, but a strategic hollowing-out of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq followed a similar trajectory. Iranian-aligned militias embedded themselves within neighborhoods, religious institutions, and political parties. Over time, they became inseparable from the state itself. U.S. military dominance did not prevent this. In fact, it often obscured it, until the architecture of influence was already in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson from both cases is straightforward: control of territory is temporary; control of networks endures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iran Is Not Afghanistan or Iraq — But the Pattern Rhymes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran today is often discussed as if pressure will produce rapid political change. That assumption ignores how power is organized inside the Islamic Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran’s security model is deliberately social. The Basij is not simply a paramilitary &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/6238623/iran-basij-militia-meaning-mahsa-amini/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;force&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; it is embedded across society—universities, workplaces, neighborhoods, religious institutions. Its purpose is not only repression, but surveillance, mobilization, and ideological reinforcement. This structure was built to survive unrest, sanctions, and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Externally, Iran has exported the same logic. In Iraq, allied militias function simultaneously as armed actors, political movements, and social providers. In Afghanistan, Iran preserved influence across regime changes, maintaining access to key actors even after the fall of the Republic. These are not improvisations; they are the product of decades of learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth remembering that Iran was not a spectator during the U.S. presence in Afghanistan and Iraq. It observed American methods up close—what worked, what failed, and where patience outperformed power. Tehran adapted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Escalation Without Preparation Backfires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moments of internal unrest often create pressure for external action. Yet Afghanistan and Iraq show that collapse—real or perceived—creates its own risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing a regime does not dismantle informal power structures. It often accelerates their consolidation. Networks that survive pressure are the ones that define what comes next. Iran’s internal system is designed precisely for this kind of stress: decentralized, redundant, and socially embedded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a strategic paradox at play. External pressure can validate internal narratives of siege and foreign threat, strengthening coercive institutions rather than weakening them. Information controls, security mobilization, and proxy signaling are not reactions; they are rehearsed responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why simplistic comparisons—whether to Eastern Europe, Latin America, or past protest movements, are misleading. Iran’s political &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/iran-crumbling-revolutionary-facade-protests&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ecosystem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is closer to the environments the United States faced in Kabul and Baghdad than many in Washington are willing to admit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who’s Reading this? More than 500K of the most influential national security experts in the world. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;full access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; to what the Experts are reading?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this suggests that Iran is immune to pressure or that its current trajectory is stable. Economic distress, generational change, and legitimacy erosion are real. But history cautions against assuming that pressure equals control or that unrest equals opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more relevant question for U.S. policymakers is not whether Iran is vulnerable, but whether the United States is prepared to operate effectively in the space that follows vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That preparation requires understanding how authority is distributed beneath formal institutions, recognizing how coercive and social systems reinforce one another, and anticipating how regional actors adapt during periods of instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the same lessons Afghanistan and Iraq offered lessons learned too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran’s current unrest has reopened a familiar debate in Washington about pressure, leverage, and escalation. But Afghanistan and Iraq should have settled that debate long ago. The United States did not lose those conflicts because it lacked military power; it lost because it underestimated how authority, loyalty, and influence actually function inside contested societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran is not a blank slate, nor is it a fragile state waiting to collapse under external strain. It is a system built to absorb pressure, manage unrest, and outlast moments of crisis. Any approach that treats unrest as an opportunity without first understanding what follows it risks repeating the same strategic error the United States has already made—twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choice facing U.S. policymakers is therefore not whether to act, but how to act without misunderstanding the terrain. Escalation without preparation does not produce control; it produces consequences that others are better positioned to manage. If Washington has truly learned from Afghanistan and Iraq, it will recognize that the most dangerous moment is not the collapse of order, but the false confidence that comes before it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History will not judge the United States on whether it applied pressure. It will judge whether it understood what that pressure would unleash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/two-men-in-a-serious-conversation-one-in-a-suit-the-other-in-a-military-uniform.jpg?id=63002583&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C44%2C0%2C44&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE KREMLIN FILES / COLUMN — &lt;/strong&gt;(Note: This is the first in a two-part &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-surveillance-state&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;series&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Russian gray zone, or hybrid warfare. In a future article, the author will address the continued evolution of Russian hybrid warfare and its practice in the years immediately leading up to and through Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian hybrid warfare, often referred to in the West as “gray zone” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/gray-zone-warfare&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conflict&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has transitioned from theoretical concept to prominent headlines, particularly following the invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin’s campaigns of sabotage, disinformation, and targeted intelligence actions across Europe and the U.S. What defines Russian-style gray warfare, or hybrid war? What are its doctrinal roots, and how well do these foundations align with assumptions in Western security discussions? To explore these questions, this article analyzes the writings of Russian military thinkers and the views of Russian military and intelligence agencies—covering their terminology, doctrines, and their evolving grasp of non-kinetic conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray zone operations in the West are generally seen as actions that influence the course of a conflict or harm an adversary without crossing into direct kinetic attacks. For Russia, at the core of the gray zone is the concept of “non-contact war” (&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;bezkontaktnaya voina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), which is part of a larger doctrinal framework under which gray warfare, also called “new generation warfare” by the Russians, falls. This is not a new concept in Russian military thinking, but it has developed over decades. By examining its evolution over the past thirty years through Russian sources and military thinkers, we can better understand how Moscow uses these concepts today—and how they influence the conflicts we may face now and in the future, enabling the U.S. and our allies to respond more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main components of Russian gray warfare. Russians rarely use the term hybrid war, which exists in Russian only as a borrowed term from English. The first concept is non-contact warfare—the concept of preparing and softening the battlefield, then minimizing ground engagements for their troops whenever possible. The second concept is Russian intelligence active measures, also known as measures of support. This is also an old idea in Russian intelligence circles, but one that has been expanded and intensified in recent decades, incorporating new elements such as cyber operations and cognitive warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will briefly discuss each of these concepts below, along with Russia’s gray-zone developments up to its deployments into Ukraine in 2014. In the second part of this series, we will analyze Russia’s doctrine as it was applied in the years immediately leading up to and through the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while also considering another key factor for Russia—their ability to evolve and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Contact Warfare: Origins and Russian Military Necessities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-contact warfare developed from what the Russian General Staff and other military thinkers called sixth-generation warfare. The concept grew from the “reconnaissance strike complex” theory and the so-called “revolution in military affairs” at the end of the Cold War. As the Soviet Union disintegrated and the U.S. demonstrated overwhelming air power with NATO and other allies during the Persian Gulf war, former Soviet and Russian generals were not fools. They understood they could not keep pace with the new advancements in air warfare and the technological edge of NATO weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian General Staff thinkers recognized that the Russian Air Force could not match TTPs (techniques, tactics, and procedures), the number of pilot training hours, or the advanced systems that the U.S. and NATO could field, especially given their significantly reduced military budget following the Soviet Union's collapse. This operational shortfall was further emphasized by the targeted bombing campaigns and overwhelming force deployed by U.S./NATO forces in the Balkan campaigns of the mid-1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

NATO airpower and the reach of the alliance into all sorts of regions and conflict zones posed a significant challenge for the Russian military and its intelligence services. One of the lessons they understood was that massed tank formations alone would not win wars in the 21st century. Throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s, several important writings were produced by prominent Russian general staff figures, such as Generals Slipchenko and Gareev, as well as the future Chief of Staff of the Russian military and currently the commander of the Russian forces in the Ukraine war, Valeriy Gerasimov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slipchenko is credited in Russia with coining the phrase “sixth generation warfare” more than twenty years ago. According to Slipchenko, this new form of warfare signified a shift from nuclear-based conflict (which he called “fifth generation”) toward information-enabled, precision-strike, so-called non-contact wars (he authored a book with that same title). These wars would be fought at a distance, relying on airpower, command, control, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (C4ISR), and long-range precision strikes, rather than large ground forces. He and Gareev published a book in Russia in 2004 titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Future Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which became influential in many Russian military circles. In this work, Slipchenko and Gareev emphasized the importance of studying non-contact warfare and firmly stated that Russia must adapt to it, or else “Russia would not survive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that same period, Russia’s Air Force struggled significantly in the 1990s and 2000s to adopt precision-guided munitions (PGMs). Russia never fully integrated them or appropriately trained them on their use, which was evident in its prolonged conflicts with Chechen separatists. Most ground-attack operations during that period, from the mid to late 1990s, relied on “dumb bombs” and massed artillery on the battlefield. This resulted in the Russian air force’s poor performance in the 2008 Georgian conflict, when an outmanned Georgian military embarrassingly shot down several Russian fighter-bombers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2008, responding to Georgia launching an incursion to retake South Ossetia, Russia responded with overwhelming force, sending an entire army to occupy swaths of Abkhazia, Ossetia, and also northern Georgia from Poti to Gori and the edges of Tbilisi. But while their force ratios led to quick success on the ground, the Russian air force did not perform as well in the air. In addition to air losses to ground-based air defense and friendly fire, Russian precision strikes did not go off as planned. Russia’s performance could be summed up as ineffective from the air. They were not able to project over-the-horizon warfare in the ways that Russian military planners had envisioned for non-contact war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first widespread and successful use of Russian PGMs would come still later, mostly during Russia’s involvement in Syria, where Russian squadrons were rotated for training and gained exposure to actual combat. Before that, many pilots had not experienced any combat outside of Chechnya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Air Force underwent a series of reforms due to these failures. It was reorganized and renamed the Russian Aerospace Forces (the VKS) in 2015 as a result of many of these reforms, or what were claimed to be reforms. When the full-scale invasion happened in 2022, Russia’s VKS, like much of its military, was still trying to evolve from its targeted reforms and these earlier developmental challenges. They attempted a limited shock-and-awe offensive but failed miserably in areas such as battle damage assessment and other key aspects of a true air campaign (the second article in this series will touch on these issues in more detail).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, military reforms and adaptations in the Russian Air Force were not meant to stand alone. Russian kinetic actions were intended to be supported by other elements in non-contact warfare, aimed at softening the battlefield and undermining an adversary’s ability to fight. Prominent among these were active measures focused on information operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active Measures, Measures of Support, and Non-state Actors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning to Russian arms doctrine, Slipchenko and other figures on the General Staff argued that, in the post–Cold War world, especially after observing the 1991 Gulf War and the dominance of US airpower, massing military forces was no longer effective. The world saw how Saddam’s large army, with thousands of tanks and armored vehicles, was destroyed from the air. Slipchenko claimed that future wars will focus on disrupting enemy systems, including military, economic, social, and other so-called “information means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was not a new concept for Russia and its intelligence agencies—the FSB, GRU, and SVR (collectively the Russian intelligence services or RIS). The RIS would play a key role by using a well-known Russian technique—active measures, or as the RIS calls them today, measures of support. These tactics aim to weaken the enemy's ability to fight through malign influence, political interference, and disinformation. The Russians use state agencies and means, like their intelligence services, but also so-called non-state actors, like organized crime, private mercenaries, hacker groups, and many others, to carry out these and other hybrid actions as proxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctrinal approach of gray war, or new generation warfare, was gaining attention in Russia just as Putin's reign started. His rule coincided with the growing influence of the RIS within the government. It was natural for the RIS to take on roles the military was not equipped to perform, and Putin was quick to authorize them. One of the first tests for their active measures and gray war was Russia’s brief war with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fpri.org/article/2025/03/russian-influence-operations-in-georgia-a-threat-to-democracy-and-regional-stability/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Georgia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2008. As noted above, and while their military’s performance was mixed, their intelligence services were very active in the information arena. Russia flooded international media with its version of events. Their still-growing “RTV” news network promoted stories of atrocities they claimed were committed by the Georgian military. Europe and the U.S. were caught off guard and unprepared by the conflict; there was little to no meaningful response to Russia’s military actions, and no high costs or reprisals. It was a lesson Russia would remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Georgia in 2008, while reforms were introduced in the air force in particular, the doctrinal debates continued. Building on Slipchenko’s ideas, writers from the General Staff, such as General Chekinov and General Bogdanov, further developed the doctrine they called “new-generation warfare.” Their work emphasized scripted roles in conflict for the information-psychological struggle, subversion, and cyber operations, while traditional large-scale combat operations became, by comparison, less prominent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the current Russian Chief of Staff,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/world/europe/russia-hybrid-war-gerasimov.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Valeriy Gerasimov, gave a speech in which he also advocated for a constant “second front” of information operations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against Russia’s enemies to weaken their ability to wage war. This speech and a later article became known in some circles in the West as the “Gerasimov doctrine,” although it was never officially called that in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerasimov’s speech and article focused on shifting Russia's attention to countering the so-called “color revolutions” that occurred in the first decade of this century in Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan. They were, and still are, viewed as a direct threat to Russia’s national security and to Putin’s dictatorship. Russia cannot tolerate functioning democracies and freedom on its borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining Gerasimov’s contributions with those of Slipchenko, Gareev, and others, the Russian military developed a concept of non-contact warfare that planned for long-range strikes executed after weakening the enemy through non-kinetic means. They de-emphasized large ground formations because, according to the theory, they should not be necessary. Russian measures of support are designed to weaken an adversary through disinformation, misinformation, malign influence on politics, and other methods. This would become the battle plan the Russians would attempt to implement in Ukraine in 2014 (and again, with adjustments, in 2022).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As cyber has taken a greater role in society and the mass media, the Russian grey zone approach has also increasingly included RIS cyber operations and online media manipulation to support “reflexive control,” an old Russian intelligence concept from the 1960s. The term reflects the notion of influencing an adversary to act in a desired way without the enemy’s awareness. Gerasimov and the military, along with leaders of the RIS, knew from Russia’s poor performance in Georgia that they were not ready for war with NATO or any strong peer-level adversary. They needed help to weaken any adversary with a capable armed force before actual war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syria and Ukraine would be the new testing grounds for this concept in practice, with a heavy reliance on the intelligence services to help prepare the battlefield before and through the military’s engagement. Their perceived successes in both theaters would, over time, convince the Russian intelligence services, its military, and most importantly, President Putin that Russia was ready for a much larger task— an attack on and seizure of the entire territory of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the US Government.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By asserting control over Venezuela’s primary sources of revenue, US President Donald Trump has replaced the moral rhetoric of his predecessors with a 21st-century version of colonial-era indirect rule. The result is a country that retains the symbols of self-government but functions as an American protectorate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent experiment involving 150 French citizens shows that when the conditions for achieving fiscal sustainability are clear and the trade-offs transparent, voters are prepared to support difficult budgetary decisions.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After decades of the one-child policy, the decline in China's fertility rate was inevitable, like a boulder rolling down a hill. With the problem now being compounded by numerous other factors, pushing the boulder back uphill will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, and will not happen quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the year began, US President Donald Trump has ramped up his aggression in the Western Hemisphere, including military intervention in Venezuela and threats to impose large sanctions on European Union countries that oppose US annexation of Greenland. Suddenly, the international order – institutions, understandings, and alliances – that underpinned economic growth for generations are at risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Long Arc Of American Power</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-long-arc-of-american-power</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;“We [the U.S.] began as a sliver of a country and next thing you know we're a continental power, and we did not do that primarily through our great diplomacy and our good looks and our charm. We did that primarily by taking the land from other people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was Michael O’Hanlon, the Brookings Institution’s Director of Research in the Foreign Policy program, speaking January 12, about his new book&lt;em&gt;, To Dare Mighty Things: U.S. Defense Strategy Since the Revolution&lt;/em&gt;, on a panel with retired-Gen. David Petraeus and Historian Robert Kagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Hanlon continued, “Now, this is not a revisionist history that's meant to beat up on the United States for having become a world power, because if we hadn't done that, if we hadn't become this continental power, then we could never have prevailed in the World Wars…The world would have been a much worse place and we could never have played the role we did in the Cold War and at least up until recent times, the post-Cold-War world. So generally speaking, I'm glad for this American assertiveness, but to me, it's striking just how little we understand that about ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening to that event eight days ago at Brookings, and looking around at what the Trump administration is doing at home and abroad today, I thought elements of what I heard from these three were worth repeating and reviewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, O’Hanlon pointed out a great amount of U.S. grand strategy and national security thinking took place during historic periods considered times of American isolationism and retrenchment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Hanlon said, “A lot of the institutional machinery, a lot of the intellectual and leadership development capability of the United States began in this period starting in the late 19th century and accelerating into the inner [World] War years [1918-to-1941]. And without that, we would not have had the great leaders like [Gen. Dwight D.] Eisenhower, and [Gen. George C.] Marshall, trained in the way they were. I think that made them ready for World War II.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, “We would not have had many of the innovations that occurred in this period of time -- so whether it's [Rear Admiral William A.] Moffett and [Navy] air power and [aircraft] carrier power, [Army Brig. Gen.] Billy Mitchell and the development of the Army Air Corps, [Marine Maj. Gen. John A.] Lejeune and the thinking about amphibious warfare. A lot of these great military leaders and innovators were doing their thing in the early decades of the 20th century and including in the inner war years in ways that prepared us for all these new innovations, all these new kinds of operations that would prove so crucial in World War II.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To me it's sort of striking,” O’Hanlon said, “how quickly we got momentum in World War II, given how underprepared we were in terms of standing armies and navies and capabilities. And by early 1943 at the latest, I think we're basically starting to win that war, which is faster than we've often turned things around in many of our conflicts in our history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagan, a Brookings senior fellow and author of the 2012 book &lt;em&gt;The World America&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Made&lt;/em&gt;, picked up on American assertiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ideologically, the United States was expansive,” Kagan said, “We had a universalist ideology. We got upset when we saw liberalism being attacked, even back in the 1820s. You know, a lot of Americans wanted to help the Greek rebellion [against the Ottoman Empire]. The world was very ideological in the 19th century and we saw ourselves as being on the side of liberalism and freedom versus genuine autocracies like Russia and Austria and Prussia. And so we always had these sympathies. Now everybody would say wait a second it's none of our business blah blah blah blah, but nevertheless the general trend was we cared.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagan went on, “People keep doing things out there that we're finding offensive in one way or another. And so we're like wanting to do something about it. So then we get dragged into, [or] we drag ourselves into these conflicts and then we say, ‘Wait a second, we're perfectly safe here [protected east and west by the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans]. Why are we involved in all this stuff?’ And then we want to come back. And so this tension between our essential security on the one hand and…our kind of busy bodyness in the world has just been has been a constant -- and I think explains why we have vacillated in terms of our military capability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petraeus, began by saying, “I'm a soldier not a historian here,” and then defended some past U.S. interventions as “basically when we've been attacked,” citing Pearl Harbor and ships being sunk in the Atlantic. He added, “Sometimes it's and/or when we fear hostile powers especially, if they're aligned as it was during the Cold War with the communists, or now arguably with China and/or Russia or both taking control of again Eurasia, Southeast Asia, East Asia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petraeus admitted, “We have sometimes misread that. You can certainly argue that Vietnam was arguably more nationalist [North Vietnamese seeking independence from France] maybe than it was communist. But that I think still applies. I think one of the motivations with respect to [Venezuelan President Nicolas] Maduro is that they [the Maduro Venezuelan leadership] were more closely than ever aligning with China, Iran to a degree, Russia and so forth. And we've seen that play out on a number of occasions as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

If they're going to be on the ground, then employ advise, assist, and enable operations where it's the host nation forces or partner forces that are on the front lines rather than Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, Petraeus said, “I think we were unprepared definitely intellectually for these operations after toppling regimes in Iraq and Afghanistan and not just [in] the catastrophically&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;bad post-conflict as phase,” citing “horrific decisions to fire the entire Iraqi military without telling them what their future was. And then firing the Baath Party down to the level of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;bureaucrats. That meant that tens of thousands [of Iraqis] without an agreed reconciliation process are literally cast out. And by the way, they're the bureaucrats that we needed to actually help us run a country [Iraq] we didn't sufficiently understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describing another lesson learned, Petraeus said, “In looking back on Afghanistan, trying to distill what happened, what we did wrong, what we did right, I really concluded that we were never truly committed to Afghanistan nation building. Rather, we were repeatedly committed to exiting. And that was a huge challenge [for the 20 years the U.S. was there], because if you tell the enemy that you're going to draw down on a given date, during the speech in which you announce a buildup, really undermines the enemy's sense of your will in what is a contest of wills at the end of the day. Not saying that we didn't want to draw down, but to do it according to the right conditions. And of course then the other challenge was that the draw-down became much more based on conditions in Washington than it did on conditions in Afghanistan, which is again another pretty fatal flaw.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagan gave his view on past American interventions with U.S. troops in foreign countries, and tied them sharply to today’s situation, not only in Caracas, but also in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You know, the United States did not go to war in Iraq to promote democracy despite the vast mythology that has grown up about that,” Kagan began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then continued, “It was primarily fear of security. Saddam was a serial aggressor. He certainly was working on weapons of mass destruction. Rightly or wrongly that was the primary motive [of the George W. Bush administration]. But then Americans, as always the case, and you know, all you have to do is look at what we did in Germany after World War II, what we did in Japan after World War II. Americans never felt very comfortable about moving into some country, taking it over for whatever reason and then turning it over to some dictator. We wanted to be able to say that we left something like democratic governance behind. Until now that has been such a key element of our self-perception and our character.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

And so we're now [with Venezuela] we’re back in that mode.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But here, Kagan gave his view of an important change from the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said, “So here's what's different. We did not want to leave in Iraq Saddam's number two. Go ahead, take over. In Venezuela, we've gone after a regime head…[but] this isn't regime change. This is decapitation and now we've turned it over to the next, you know, part of the Maduro regime and said you take care of it. We'll run it, but you take care of it. That is a departure from American history and I think it is directly a consequence of the fact that for the first time I can&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;say without any doubt we do not have a president who believes in the American principles of liberalism, but is actively hostile to them here in the United States as well as internationally. He is on the side of anti-liberalism. He is on the side of authoritarianism, both here and abroad. That, to my mind, it's not do we intervene in Latin America, Yes, we do, but for what purpose? And I think that is the huge break [from the past] that we're witnessing right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To my mind and others, Kagan has it right. President Trump, facing political problems at home – affordability, the Epstein files, the upcoming November House and Senate elections – has tried to show expanding power abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on past success in Iran bombing nuclear sites and removing Maduro from Venezuela, Trump wants to absorb Greenland, send U.S. forces into Mexico after drug cartels, and threaten attacking the faltering regime in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me add a final element to Trump’s current eagerness to show power abroad. The one thing he doesn’t want is the death of any U.S. military personnel he sends into harm’s way. Trump and his top aides have repeatedly pointed out, whether it was in blowing up narco-trafficking boats or the Iran bombing or the Maduro snatch, no American lives were lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>New Reports Reveal Years of Unaddressed Osprey Safety Risks</title>

The Naval Air Systems Command&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.usni.org/2025/12/12/navy-and-gao-reports-v-22-osprey-program&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Government Accountability Office&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/12/new-gao-navy-reports-warn-serious-v-22-osprey-safety-risks-some-fixes-stretching-2030s/410150/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; paint a scathing portrait of systemic failures by the Joint Program Office overseeing V-22 variants for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Marine Corps&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.usni.org/2025/09/16/report-to-congress-on-v-22-osprey-aircraft&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;operates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; approximately 348 MV-22s, the Air Force 52 CV-22s, and the Navy 29 CMV-22s, with the program of record at around 464 total across services. Japan operates 17 MV-22s, with deliveries complete or near-complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Deadly Track Record&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 30 U.S. Marines lost their lives in three&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/12/new-gao-navy-reports-warn-serious-v-22-osprey-safety-risks-some-fixes-stretching-2030s/410150/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;separate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; crashes during the testing and development phase throughout the 1990s, giving the Osprey the nickname “The Widow Maker.” Since its introduction in 2007, at least 35&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48703&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;servicemembers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have died in 10 fatal crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Initially, the V-22 suffered from Vortex Ring State, which produced crashes during development. The problem was diagnosed and remediated, and the loss rate went down dramatically,” John Pike, a leading defense, space and intelligence policy expert and Director of GlobalSecurity.org, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Subsequent losses have been ‘normal accidents’ due to the usual mechanical and human failings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GAO&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/2025/12/gao-finds-v-22-serious-accident-rate-shot-up-in-2023-2024/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;found&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that serious Osprey mishaps in 2023 and 2024 exceeded the previous eight years and generally surpassed accident rates of other Navy and Air Force aircraft. In August 2023, three Marines died in Australia. In 2022, four U.S. soldiers were killed in a NATO training mission, and five Marines were killed in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unresolved Problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NAVAIR report&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2025-12-12/navy-investigation-finds-osprey-safety-issues-were-allowed-to-grow-for-years&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;revealed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “the cumulative risk posture of the V-22 platform has been growing since initial fielding,” and the program office “has not promptly implemented fixes.” Of 12 Class A mishaps in the past four years, seven involved parts failures already identified as major problems but not addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues with hard-clutch engagement (HCE) caused the July 2022 California crash that killed five. The problem occurs when the clutch connecting the engine to the propeller gearbox slips and reengages abruptly, causing a power spike that can throw the aircraft into an uncontrolled roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were eight Air Force servicemembers killed in the November 2023 crash off Yakushima Island when a catastrophic propeller gearbox failed due to cracks in the metal pinion gear, and the pilot continued flying despite multiple warnings, contributing to the crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This manufacturing issue&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2025-12-12/navy-investigation-finds-osprey-safety-issues-were-allowed-to-grow-for-years&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;dates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to 2006, but the Joint Program Office didn’t formally assess the risk until March 2024 – nearly two decades later.

As five of the eight Navy helicopters that arrived at Desert One were inoperable, it was clear that rapid troop movement in harsh environmental conditions was urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After development began in 1985, the Osprey entered service in 2007, replacing the Vietnam-era CH-46 Sea Knight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to fixed-wing transports, the Osprey can land troops just where they are needed. Airdrops with parachutes tend to scatter paratroops all over the place; see ‘Saving Private Ryan,’” Pike explained. “And compared with other rotary wing aircraft, the Osprey is much faster and has a much longer range.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Osprey shifts from helicopter to airplane mode in under 12 seconds, reaches speeds of 315 mph, has an operational range of 580 miles, and carries 10,000 pounds – or 24 troops. It’s used for missions ranging from combat operations to the occasional transport of White House staff. During a dust storm in Afghanistan in 2010, two CV-22 helicopters rescued 32 soldiers in under four hours from a distance of 800 miles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic Readiness Problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet these performance advantages have been undercut by persistent readiness shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NAVAIR report&lt;a href=&quot;https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/v-22-ospreys-safety-risks-navair-review-confirms/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;noted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that mission-capable rates between 2020 and 2024 averaged just 50 percent for the Navy and Air Force, and 60 percent for Marines. The Osprey&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2025/12/12/v-22-osprey-at-risk-of-more-catastrophic-mishaps-navy-review-finds/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;requires&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 100 percent more unscheduled maintenance than the Navy averages and 22 maintenance man-hours per flight hour versus 12 for other aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Boeing settled a whistleblower lawsuit in 2023 for $8.1 million after employees accused the company of falsifying records for composite part testing. Boeing, in its defense,&lt;a href=&quot;https://halifax.citynews.ca/2023/12/07/ospreys-had-safety-issues-long-before-they-were-grounded-a-look-at-the-aircrafts-history/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;claimed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the parts were “non-critical” and did not impact flight safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflicting Views on Safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Osprey does not have a troubled safety record. Per a recent press release, the V-22 mishap rate per 100,000 flight hours is 3.28, which is in line with helicopters with similar missions.” a government source who works closely with the Osprey fleet but is not authorized to speak on the record contended to &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Like anything measured statistically, there are periods above and below the mean. Just because humans tend to conclude because of apparent clusters doesn’t necessarily mean there is a pattern or connection – think of how some people say that ‘celebrities die in threes.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source vowed that “the design issues, such as certain electrical wiring rubbing against hydraulic and oil lines, were fixed before fleet introduction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problems with the test plan were a product of pressure applied to accelerate a delayed and overbudget program and were not repeated when the aircraft was reintroduced,” the insider pointed out. “Those mishaps, combined with the distinctive nature of the V-22, mean that any subsequent incident, major or minor, is always viewed as part of the ‘dangerous V-22’ narrative. A U.S. Army Blackhawk crash in November killed five but barely made the news. A Japanese Blackhawk crash killed ten soldiers in April, but the Japanese didn’t ground their Blackhawks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That perception, however, has done little to quiet families who argue that known risks went unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amber Sax’s husband, Marine Corps Capt. John J. Sax died in the 2022 California crash caused by hard clutch engagement, a problem the Marine Corps had known about for over a decade. “Their findings confirm what we already know: More needs to be done, and more needs to be done,” Sax&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/12/new-gao-navy-reports-warn-serious-v-22-osprey-safety-risks-some-fixes-stretching-2030s/410150/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s clear in the report that these risks were not properly assessed, and that failure cost my husband his life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

In 2018, the Marine Corps Aviation proposal&lt;a href=&quot;https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/marine-corps-fly-osprey-2060-prep-aircraft-future-wars-31517&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;outlined&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a sustainability plan for the Osprey to at least 2060.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The quality of maintenance training curricula, maturation, and standardization has not kept pace with readiness requirements,” the report&lt;a href=&quot;https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/marine-corps-fly-osprey-2060-prep-aircraft-future-wars-31517&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;stated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Current maintenance manning levels are unable to support demands for labor. The current V-22 sustainment system cannot realize improved and sustained aircraft readiness and availability without significant change. Depot-level maintenance cannot keep up with demand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite extensive recommendations – NAVAIR&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/2025/12/gao-finds-v-22-serious-accident-rate-shot-up-in-2023-2024/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;underscored&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 32 actions to improve safety – Vice Adm. John Dougherty reaffirmed commitment to the aircraft. Pike believes it’s a matter of when, not if, the Osprey returns to full operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once the issues are fixed, everyone will resume their regular programming,” he asserted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials and insiders alike expect that process to translate into tangible fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would expect that to lead to some type of corrective action, whether it’s a new procedure or replacing a defective part,” the insider added. “After that, I would expect a long career for the aircraft in the Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force, as it’s an irreplaceable part of all three services now and gives a unique capability to the American military.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether that optimism proves warranted depends on whether military leadership finally addresses the systemic failures the latest reports have laid bare – failures that cost 20 service members their lives in just the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The World Economic Forum meeting in Davos will feature the usual pledges about stakeholder capitalism, purpose-driven business, and sustainable development. But without binding conditionalities, accountability frameworks, and risk-sharing that distinguish genuine value creators from rent extractors, it remains theater.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Global financial stability has long depended on the dollar’s role as the main reserve currency, with the expectation that the United States would both set the rules and uphold them. As American leadership grows more erratic, that dependence has become a vulnerability, underscoring the need for a multicurrency system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tech evangelists view climate change as an information problem that the arrival of AI superintelligence will solve, rather than a willpower problem that requires concrete measures, like modernizing the electrical grid and implementing a carbon tax. But there can be no miracle fix once critical planetary tipping points are crossed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Coast Guard's Mission in the Gray Zone</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-coast-guard-s-mission-in-the-gray-zone</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION&lt;/strong&gt; — U.S. defense planning rests on the assumption that wars are fought abroad, by expeditionary forces, against defined adversaries. For decades, those assumptions held. But today, many of the most consequential security challenges facing the United States violate all three. They occur closer to home, below the threshold of armed conflict, and in domains where sovereignty is enforced incrementally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift has exposed a chronic mismatch between how the United States defines its defense priorities and how it allocates resources and respect. While defense discourse continues to stubbornly emphasize power projection and high-end conflict, many of today’s challenges revolve around the more modest and rote enforcement of U.S. territorial integrity and national sovereignty - functions that are vital to U.S. strategic objectives yet lack the optical prestige of winning wars abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the center of this gap between prestige and need is the U.S. Coast Guard, whose mission profile aligns directly with America’s most important strategic objectives - the enforcement of sovereignty and homeland defense - yet remains strategically undervalued because its work rarely resembles the celebrated and well-funded styles of conventional warfighting. In an era of increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/gray-zone-warfare&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;gray-zone&lt;/a&gt; competition and persistent coercion, the failure to properly appreciate the Coast Guard threatens real strategic fallout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third decade of the 21st century, U.S. defense planning remains heavily oriented toward expeditionary warfighting and high-end kinetic conflict. Budget conversations still revolve around Ford-class supercarriers, F-35 fighters, and A2/AD penetration. This orientation shapes not only force design and budget allocations, but also institutional prestige and political capital. The services associated with visible combat power, with the Ford-class and the F-35, continue to dominate strategic discourse—even as many of the most persistent security challenges confronting the United States unfold close to home, in the gray-zone, without the need for fifth-generation air power or heavy armor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Power projection, forward presence, and deterrence abroad are important—but they are secondary functions derived from the primary purpose of homeland defense. Yet U.S. defense discourse often treats homeland defense as a background condition when it should be revered as the first priority. The result is a blind spot in how security resources are evaluated and allocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coast Guard operates at a unique point where law enforcement, military authority, and sovereign enforcement all converge. On any given day, the Coast Guard may board foreign-flagged vessels suspected of sanctions violations, police maritime borders against illicit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-u-s-coast-guards-quiet-drug-war-wins-amid-trumps-caribbean-strikes&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;trafficking&lt;/a&gt;, secure ports that underpin global supply chains, and maintain a persistent presence in contested spaces, like the Arctic, without inviting escalation. The Coast Guard is equipped to intercept illegal fishing fleets, escort commercial shipping through sensitive waterways, and assert jurisdiction in legally ambiguous areas. These activities rarely resemble traditional warfighting, they rarely result in a Hollywood blockbuster, and they can be accomplished without nuclear-powered submarines or intercontinental ballistic missiles. But these are not peripheral activities—they are arguably amongst the most important daily functions the U.S. military undertakes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinct among the military branches, the Coast Guard operates under a legal framework that is uniquely suited to today’s security environment. Under Title 14 status, the Coast Guard falls within the Department of Homeland Security, conducting law enforcement and regulatory missions on a daily basis. Yet, when needed, the service can transition to Title 10 status, under the Department of Defense, and operate as an armed service when required. This agility allows the Coast Guard to remain continuously engaged across the spectrum of competition, whether enforcing U.S. law in peacetime, managing escalation in gray-zone encounters, or integrating seamlessly into military operations. Few other elements of U.S. power can move so fluidly between legal regimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, despite such strategic relevance, the Coast Guard suffers from a persistent optical problem. U.S. defense culture has long privileged services and missions associated with visible, kinetic combat—those that lend themselves to clear narratives of victory, sacrifice, and heroism. The Coast Guard’s work rarely fits that cinematic mold. Its success is measured not in territory seized or targets destroyed, but in disruptions prevented, borders enforced, and crises that never materialize. Inherently quiet work with outcomes that reflect a force operating exactly as designed, although without generating institutional prestige or political support. In a system that rewards the loudest and the brightest, the Coast Guard’s quiet enforcement of sovereignty is easy to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

Specifically, persistent underinvestment in the Coast Guard weakens maritime domain awareness, reduces sustained presence in key waterways, and narrows the set of tools available to manage gray-zone competition. As adversaries increasingly rely on legal ambiguity, deniable actors, and incremental pressure to test U.S. resolve, gaps in enforcement become opportunities. In this environment, the absence of credible, continuous sovereignty enforcement invites probing behavior that becomes harder to deter over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocacy for the Coast Guard does not require reassigning prestige, or elevating one service at the expense of others. It is merely an argument for strategic alignment. If territorial integrity, sovereignty enforcement, and homeland defense are truly core national-security priorities, then the institutions most directly responsible for those missions should be treated accordingly. As competition increasingly unfolds in the gray-zone between peace and war, the United States will need forces designed not only to win conflicts—but to prevent them from starting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>The Country’s First ‘Cognitive Advantage’ Chief: Influence Is the New Battlefield</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-countrys-first-cognitive-advantage-chief-influence-is-the-new-battlefield</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/washington-dc-united-states-december-1-an-exterior-view-of-the-white-house-in-washington-dc-united-states-on-december-1-2.jpg?id=62826168&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C68%2C0%2C69&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEEKEND INTERVIEW — &lt;/strong&gt;In an era when foreign adversaries can shape public sentiment with a well-timed meme and a handful of AI-driven accounts, the U.S. government is racing to redefine what national power looks like in the information age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the center of that effort is Shawn Chenoweth, the country’s first Director of Cognitive Advantage - a role designed to help the United States compete in the domain where modern influence, persuasion, and political outcomes are increasingly decided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, exactly, does a Director of Cognitive Advantage do? It’s not a title most Americans encounter, and it sits far outside the familiar contours of diplomacy, military force, or economic leverage. But as Chenoweth explains, the contest for influence no longer stays neatly within those lanes either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His focus is often on the gray space - where information, perception, culture, and behavior collide, and where adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are operating with staggering resources and strategic focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;em&gt;Cipher Brief &lt;/em&gt;conversation, Chenoweth breaks down how cognitive operations actually work, why the U.S. has struggled to keep pace, and what it means to give the President an “information option” that’s not simply kinetic or economic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He offers rare, candid insight into how technology, AI, and social platforms—from TikTok to algorithmically driven personas—are reshaping the battlespace faster than policymakers can write doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our conversation is a deep dive into one of the least understood - but perhaps most consequential - fronts of modern national security. &lt;em&gt;Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Chenoweth&lt;/strong&gt;, Director of Cognitive Advantage, National Security Council&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE INTERVIEW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: How do you explain the role of the director of Cognitive Advantage?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;When you look at traditional elements of military power, you probably think of the DIME construct&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It's not a perfect construct, but it's pretty good. DIME, is broken down into Diplomatic, Information, Military and Economic, and it's very clear who owns the Diplomatic, Military, and Economic components. But there hasn't been, at least in several decades, a good example of where people have really come to the president and the administration with an &quot;I&quot; option, for Information. And it's a shame because when you actually look at the DIME construct, you don't want to break it into stove pipes. We should think of it as a cell. Each of those elements acts as part of a functioning cell, and removing any of those elements means you have an imperfect or failing cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I was asked to help put the &quot;I&quot; back in DIME so that we can provide additional options and advantages across the other elements of DIME to national power and provide the president with opportunities to accomplish the Administration’s objectives that aren't just warheads on foreheads or threatening economics or expending political leverage. We can enhance those things, but we can also gain advantages by using cognitive effects through the information environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Let’s set the stage a bit further. If you were to explain to the average American what is happening in terms of cognitive warfare in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/how-can-the-u-s-better-manage-the-gray-zone&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;gray zone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; – the area where conflict occurs below the level of warfare - how would you describe it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I think if you look through your military histories, philosophers, politicians, political science, it's all pretty clear. You can pick out the elements. They all have one underlying thread, which is that political victory is the one that matters at its core. That's really what we're talking about. Nothing's changed. How human beings are connected, how technology is affected has certainly changed. But what we really care about is what people do in the real world and the geophysical world, the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the point of a cognitive advantage is to leverage that so that human beings are taking behaviors favorable to outcomes, to national objectives, which most of the time are also - in the case of the United States - favorable in their own right. So it's core. And that is what we're driving to get: those advantages in what people do in the real world through their sensing, to make decisions that come back to the real world and have the effects that you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Can you give an example of what that would look like?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Let's say you're negotiating for a piece of land or a base that you need for overflight intel collection. You're going to conduct a trade-off in negotiations. Maybe it's going to look like, - if you pay more, you'll get more - based off what the value proposition is. But very rarely is it that blatant and simple. So, what you want to be able to do is understand, what advantage would we need in the negotiation? What's actually driving this other party other than maybe just cost or just danger? What’s the risk calculus?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are cultural nuances that affect things: their understanding of influence, political implications. So, the point would be to understand why they would be interested in this in the first place? What advantage does it give them? What are the cultural nuances? Why wouldn't they do this in the first place? Why aren't they taking this action and what can we do to make sure that the outcome is what we want?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other areas where that applies across the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's say we're conducting counter-terrorism operations, and we know an objective tends to use a particular cafe. Well, what if they were using a different one that day? What can we do to influence them to go to a place that's more favorable for options to decrease our own risk calculus, either because we want to conduct a kinetic strike or make an arrest? Maybe we can't find them. So, what if we use that for our intel collection and our methods to basically make them come up on comms and change their behavior so it's easier to find them, collect on them, and build the data so that we can conduct physical actions to stop or disrupt them? And you can kind of see how that applies across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you know more than the person you're dealing with, chances are that you're going to be better at accomplishing your outcome. It’s very similar with the werewolf theory. It's a game where two people are chosen to be the werewolf of the village and everyone else in the group doesn't know who the werewolf is. Most of the time the people who are the werewolves win the game because they have an information advantage over everyone else playing the game. So, it's a human norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And again, I point out that nothing's new under the sun. It's just that we haven't really thought through the implications of what it means in the information age that we live in - where everyone is connected through software defined radios. We're a long way away from direct sensing where it's communication and things happening in the real world. Now we have sort of indirect sensing where you're fed data feeds and everything else. We can affect cognitive behavior in ways we never imagined, and we really haven't thought through just as we can reach people and sell items. And if I want to find a person whose favorite color is red, who's a military age male who's really into Magnum PI, I can find that person thanks to their radio, and I can craft messages specifically for someone who fits that demographic and move them in a particular direction. That's the first time in history that that's been the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: You have a background that combines both government and private sector experience. Given that technology is being rapidly developed in the private sector, how do you think that background gives you an advantage in this role?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; There are a lot of people who've served in the military and have been contractors but just by happenstance, I happen to have been in a lot of critical locations at critical times. I think one of the advantages that has brought me is that I saw the frustration within the military when the contracting apparatus didn't work. I was also empowered by industry to go and fix a lot of those structures and enable the government to do it, and now I'm getting afforded the opportunity to work on policy to make the system really hum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the advantage with that is that when it comes to the information space, there's no control. And I try to emphasize this to any policy maker or power broker or decision maker that I can find. You can put an armored brigade in an intersection - fully equipped, fully supported – and a U.S. Armored Brigade could own that intersection. There are things you can control. But when it comes to the information space, there is no control. It is constantly shifting, constantly changing. You have a binary decision. You are either going to participate, preferably at a level that matters, or not, and whatever's going to happen is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you could find yourself in an advantageous information space in the morning, lose it by the late morning, get a stalemate in the afternoon, and win it back in the afternoon – just to lose it again at the end of the day. And when you wake up the next morning, you're going to have to do it all over again. There is no, &quot;We have information dominance and we're done and we can crack our beers and go on with other things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not how this works because every day new information is being injected into the system. People are changing and developing new opinions. Things are occurring and people are going to react to those things, change their opinions, adapt, age out, age in, so those cultural references may change. It's a constant flux. One of the things that from the U.S. government side we're getting our head around is that we need an information carrier group constantly operating afloat in the information environment, effectively. One that’s engaged 24/7 to affect these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is partnering with the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Information Professionals Association and the National Center for Narrative Intelligence to bring you Pinnacle 2026: Gray Zone Convergence: Cognitive Security at the Intersection of Influence, Innovation, and Shared Interests. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://information-professionals.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2044c7e92c443c50b2129bd22&amp;amp;id=61b2b7f847&amp;amp;e=f8392d200d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://information-professionals.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2044c7e92c443c50b2129bd22&amp;amp;id=61b2b7f847&amp;amp;e=f8392d200d&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Register for the February 9-10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; conference now to secure your spot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: It's not just the United States that has gotten pretty good at understanding the impact of cognitive advantage. We see these tactics from China and Russia being used with stunning success. In this role, how focused are you on their activities when it comes to doing the exact same thing that you're tasked with doing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;They absolutely practice these activities. I call them the ‘CRINKETT’. Every challenge we're generally dealing with falls in the CRINKETTS. It's China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Terrorists and Trans[national] criminals. And particularly for the nation states, this is exactly how they want to compete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From their perspective, there are two ways to deal with the United States: asymmetrically and stupidly, largely because of our economic and military power. They get that. They're not interested in a kinetic fight; that is an awful prospect. So the way they want to do this is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/gray-zone-warfare&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;gray zone activities&lt;/a&gt;, in the information space, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/21st-century-cognitive-advantage&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;cognitive domain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they outspend us. I'm not going to say necessarily outperform, but I'll say if you want to compete at a level that matters, they outspend us, period. Iran probably spends around $1.8 billion plus-minus a year, maybe more with their proxies and everything else they do in this particular space. Russia - post Ukraine invasion, spends about $2.6 billion, something like that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/china-gray-zone-war&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; - 48 plus billion dollars a year. The U.S., if I take all of the activities from the DoD, the State Department and everything else, and you put those together, you might approach $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't mean we're executing those funds either. It just means that that's what we've allocated. When you think about how we outspend to have an advantage on the other parts of DIME, we're hideously underperforming here. And again, all props to the administration. They're acutely aware of this and the support I've had at the National Security Council and across the elements of government - the departments and agencies - has been stellar. And we're going to continue to work on this and get it right because we have three and a half more years of President Trump's administration to get this right, do the reps and sets, and make this a durable policy so that the American people can start enjoying those benefits that come when we're really focused on this space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: What does success look like for you in this role and how do you measure it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Measurement has always been a funny thing. People will constantly tell me how hard it is to measure these activities. And what I’ve found time and time again is that we're actually pretty good at these activities. The issues with the measurements are, again, participating at a scale that matters. We need to measure behavior change, and in order to do that, we need to have clear objectives. What are we after?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big part of that is who is the target audience that has the agency to do the thing we want? We spend a lot of time making plans and CONOPS [Concept of Operations] on sub-target audiences that don't actually have the agency – in hopes that they affect agency - and that's perfectly fine. But why are we doing assessments against this? We spend a lot of time and money generating assessments to target audiences that don't have the agency you want. So, let's focus on the target audience that has the agency and let's do this at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example; I'm in the DC area and I can go down to the Potomac River, drop a bucket of water in the river, and I have objectively molecularly increased the amount of water in the Potomac. There isn't a sensor on this planet that is going to detect that molecular change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact is that you might be having an effect, but you don't have a sensor that is going to pick that up. So, you need to increase your scale or customize your sensing system to the effect you're having. That tends to be where the assessments fall apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard all the time for decades now that assessments are so hard. I don't find that to be true. What I find is that you've sacrificed assessments for effect, which is fine. It's risk calculus. If I had a low amount of resources and I decided to put as much into the effect I've wanted, that's fine. But at the end of the day, you're looking for the real behavior change in the targeted audience that matters. What are the sensors you have on that and what are you doing to collect that data: public opinion, research surveys, building the networks. We're going to see this exacerbate further as the AI revolution continues at pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: How is technology impacting what you're trying to do, your mission, and then how are you also working with the private sector because the private sector is controlling so much of the technology and the innovation that the government needs to work with. So how are you doing that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;One of the challenges I see emerging from AI is that there's sort of an assumption that AI will fix all your woes. I've seen the best tools out there do one thing: they model the data they have, and that's the core issue. We don't have the data. So again, I'm back to there's not a whole lot of new things under the sun. And the AI models are really good, and it can allow you to find new insights from the data that you have, but new data needs to be created. So, sacrificing collection methodologies and new approaches to gather the data at the foot of a model is terrible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI snake oil salesman I would deal with in industry all the time would come in and say, ‘&lt;em&gt;Oh, you're interested in that? I could absolutely model you the thing&lt;/em&gt;.’ Cool. How does that work? &lt;em&gt;‘Well, all you have to do is provide me the data and we'll put all this together and give you the insights.&lt;/em&gt;’ I'm like, &lt;em&gt;whoa&lt;/em&gt;. We don't have the data either. No one has the data. That's kind of the problem. So, let's be honest about what we're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is going to be a great boon for industry and for the government and everyone else under the sun. It's going to obviously have impact, but I think as that moves forward, we need to start looking at how we actually employ it. Building an agent or a token for every worker so that they're augmented by an AI that does the thing that they themselves may not be good at or saving them time is going to be amazing, but it needs to be undergirded by being able to detect what's actually happening out in the real world. And those two things are not necessarily - not interrelated. As I said, most things are kind of a whole cell that operate in one unit, and we can't necessarily bifurcate these things and then expect good outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Former Senior CIA Executive Dave Pitts wrote a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/how-can-the-u-s-better-manage-the-gray-zone&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;three-part series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; exclusively for The Cipher Brief on what the U.S. can do to become more competitive in the Gray Zone.

If you could explaine to the average U.S. citizen how they might be targeted by cognitive operations that are conducted by U.S. adversaries, what would you tell them to look for?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;You need to be mindful of sources obviously. When I look at the construct of how we approach cognitive warfare, I think one of the biggest problems I've had for at least the last 10 years has been the construct of dis- and misinformation. My issue isn't the dis- and misinformation construct. It's the overuse of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disinformation and misinformation are things. They have meaning. But they mean something that is true and people use it for things that are not true. For example, disinformation are lies. The person projecting the information knows it's a lie. They're doing it to accomplish an objective. The bigger problem of disinformation is misinformation. Those are people who are sharing those lies, not knowing they are lies, or taking things out of context like satire, et cetera, and propagating as if it were truth. Those are what those are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not everything we have to deal with falls into that construct. There are two other portions to this that we have to be mindful of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is missing information, which used to mean that the target audience wasn't informed enough to make a correct decision, favorable to them or anyone else. ‘&lt;em&gt;It's a tragedy that your family member died and you should mourn their loss, but stop touching the body. That's how you're spreading Ebola&lt;/em&gt;’, right? Pretty straightforward, pretty simple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we're dealing with nation states with deep pockets, that's been flipped up on its head and they're practicing active missing information, where they will provide wire services into a country saying, &lt;em&gt;‘Congratulations, you can use our wire service for free and we'll provide you all the stuff, and that's your biggest cost except for labor. Isn't that wonderful? The catch is that you just have to use our wire service’&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think [contextual] stories are going to get into the press through those channels, good luck. This isn't happening in the third world. These are happening in major countries and places that would shock you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine something like,&lt;em&gt; ‘If you run this story, all our connected businesses that are connected through us or other means are going to pull their advertising budget from you.’&lt;/em&gt; So again, good luck talking about the story in your environment. No one's going to touch it. No influencer wants a piece of it because they're going to lose their incentive structure and their revenue stream. It's things like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the coin, and the bigger problem, is the rhetoric information. These are the things that aren't necessarily true or false. They are framed by your value system, how you view things, what you think truth actually is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are people out there who will say, I think a communist socialist form of government that is highly authoritarian is more stable and therefore better than a liberal democracy. There are people who believe that, and just by saying, well, history would prove you otherwise, it's not a good enough argument. You need to engage with those people at a scale that matters and be prepared to win the argument. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've seen this time again on the counter-terrorism front where we would shut down the comms of a nobody, and suddenly that person would come back with the reputation that was so valuable, and now they're a terrorist thought leader because the Western world thought that they were so dangerous they needed to be shut down instead of just accepting the fact, that maybe we should just engage with this guy because no one's ever heard of him and maybe we should just point out that he's a moron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are ways to deal with this, and just because we don't like something doesn't mean it's a lie to the person that's spreading it. They might believe it. Before we just title something disinformation and say, well, it's a lie and we can ignore it — that is not adequate in the modern era where everyone is connected because, again, this person has connective tissue to the internet. They have web platforms. They can be just as connected as a government if they should choose to be and if they have the popularity, because at its core, regardless of whether or not you're a government or a celebrity or anything else, you are fighting for attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: It’s sometimes difficult for busy Americans to navigate the information space today and know what to believe without inviting some serious time into the source. Do you look at part of your mission in this role as helping people understand more of the context they need in order to make good decisions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I've been more on the side dealing with foreign audiences. But even in that regard, I think that it really matters to ask what are the things that we know to be what we feel are objective truths and things that matter? Things that we want target audiences to know because we know it would be better for them and better for our objectives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then what are the things where we just want to make sure that if a debate needs to be had, we facilitate the debate so that the target audience, particularly with an American target audience - which again, it's not my forte, we don't do that in government or shouldn't — that needs to be facilitated by Americans pointing out to each other that we do need to have these debates and come to kind of consensus, understanding that there will be disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Do you think your job is going to be even more important in the future or maybe less?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I've never thought the job wasn't important. I think the thing I'm enjoying right now is that everyone's kind of getting their head around what this means. The overused expression that ‘&lt;em&gt;We need to do some things on Facebook&lt;/em&gt;,’ when you would have policymakers say, ‘&lt;em&gt;Well, I'm concerned that that would destroy Amazon and internet commerce’&lt;/em&gt; and your head would explode as you're trying to explain, ‘&lt;em&gt;That's just not how the internet works, man&lt;/em&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can be comfortable operating on these platforms and doing things that we need to do without destroying internet commerce or the internet. And now I think a lot of policy makers and industry are all connected. They're a lot more comfortable doing these things. Now is the time when we need to get to where the resources and the permissions really match the ability to get us where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've generally not found too many authority problems. I generally find permissions problems. I find that when it comes to authorities, you almost always find that every organization actually has a framework that allows them to do things. It's just that someone somewhere in the chain can say no and is all too comfortable saying no, because, particularly in the past administration, they were very comfortable at avoiding risk and not as comfortable at managing risk. And that is a dynamic that we have to change. The world is a risky place, and we need to be out there participating in it, throwing our elbows around and managing the risk, not avoiding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: How hard of a job is it to give the U.S. the cognitive advantage in today’s world?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It's hard, tremendously hard because you're talking about changing culture. I don't think the activity itself and the policy and the things that can be done are hard. I think the hard part will be changing the culture and changing people's mindsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've talked about the fact that there used to be three domains: physical domain, information domain and cognitive domain. We have to explore the information domain and actually call it what it is. There is the physical domain, the geophysical domain. But I like the ‘kill web’ approach. A good kill web will constitute a kill chain that is disrupted, and we have to get out of just a kill chain. We need to get into a kill web mentality when it comes to cognitive effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Explain what you mean by a “kill web”?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You have your geophysical world where things exist in the real world, the place where we all live. When it comes to the information domain, though, it used to consolidate a bunch of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality is that when we break that down into a kill web, you're looking from your physical domain up to your logic layer. The internet is not some amorphous cloud that wanders around. It's composed of a system of systems that live in the real world. It's data centers, servers, modems, et cetera. Where does that infrastructure actually exist? Sometimes the files are in the computer. So, we need to be mindful of where does that work? How does the internet, how do these structures work, the mobile networks, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, it then creates the digital layer, where all the trons are that exist. You can have effects, that's where your real cyberspace comes into play. That's how the mobile devices work, but that is just data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it goes up to the persona entity level. These are the real human beings, sometimes fake human beings, they're personas, organizations but entities that potentially could be targeted or addressed or engaged, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there's the cognitive space. The trick in the cognitive space is what happens in the mind. And that mind is influenced by the sensing that goes up through that chain when they process it. You're able to interdict on its way up or influence, and you're able to influence on the way down when a decision is made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, when something happens in the real world, it's communicated to a decision maker, but it's going to go through the logic layer transmitted through sensors, computers, emails, phones, et cetera, to people and entities who are going to process it themselves, communicate it to a decision maker who's going to make a decision based off that information, or an individual or a bunch of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're all going to make decisions on how to react to that or not react to that. And that's going to go back down to the physical world when they say, ‘&lt;em&gt;I don't really like what is happening&lt;/em&gt;’, or maybe ‘&lt;em&gt;I do like what's happening. Let's do the thing’&lt;/em&gt;. They're going to communicate that down to ‘&lt;em&gt;Yes, launch the missiles’&lt;/em&gt;, or ‘&lt;em&gt;Let's have a protest’&lt;/em&gt;. So, you can affect the chain up. You can affect the chain down, but that's how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We as the United States have a pipe that exists inside that kill web structure - so does everyone else. And it doesn't matter if you're a nation state or a family or an individual. You have your sensing sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the direct conversations between people in the real world - even now, you and I are communicating completely over that entire structure - and that structure could be affected on the way up as we're communicating to when this is finally produced and goes back out to the real world where suddenly I have AI effects on me and I'm saying things I never meant to say, but the rest of the world's now interpreting that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't say that, that wasn't my cognitive decision, but you intercepted on the way down and now you would inadvertently affect everyone else's cognitive approach to what I'm communicating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: What does the future from a technology and AI standpoint really look like?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It's having fundamental changes. It's going to be interesting to see what happens in the entertainment industry as AI takes over and suddenly people can have more access. We've seen how the music industry went through huge change just on streaming music. We're about to witness what this is going to look like from our more traditional platforms. We've seen how things move from streaming. I think there is a level of adaptation that's going to go with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that needs to be addressed is how exactly we're going to engage. There is a point where we need to be comfortable with giving sort of guidance to the AIs - human in the loop - but if you think that you're going to be able to review every single message that needs to go out in an AI-driven world, you're out of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you need to be able to be comfortable generating for your target audience profiles and give sort of thematic guidance and let the AI do some level of engagements against foreign audiences to steer conversations in a particular direction, or at least identify where a conversation might be going so you can intervene when it looks like decisions are being made in a bad way, and then find out if that is an open and honest cultural nuance thing where it is about engagement or if it's being steered by your opponent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that we are not far, and we're probably already in a game, where there are AIs versus AIs as we speak in the information environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What U.S. – China Cooperation Means for the World</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/what-u-s-china-cooperation-means-for-the-world</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION --&lt;/strong&gt; China was very critical of the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last week. The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the U.S. action was “blatant interference” in Venezuela and a violation of international law. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Maduro was accused of working with Columbian guerrilla groups to traffic cocaine into the U.S. as part of a “narco-terrorism” conspiracy. Of all countries, China should appreciate the need to stop Mr. Maduro from smuggling these illicit drugs into the U.S., killing tens of thousands of Americans. China experienced this in the Opium War of 1839-1842, when Great Britain forced opium on China, despite government protestations, resulting in the humiliating Treaty of Nanjing, ceding Hong Kong to Great Britain. Mr. Maduro was violating U.S. laws, in a conspiracy to aid enemies and kill innocent Americans. Fortunately, the U.S. had the political will, and military might, to quickly and effectively put an end to this assault. China should understand this and withhold criticism, despite their close relationship with Mr. Maduro and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheduled April meeting of presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping will hopefully ease tension related to the South China Sea and Taiwan. The meeting will also offer an opportunity of the two presidents to elaborate on those transnational issues that the U.S. and China can work together on, for the common good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Security Strategy of 2025 states that deterring a conflict over Taiwan is a priority and does not support any unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. It also states that one-third of global shipping passes annually through the South China Sea and its implications for the U.S. economy are obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It’s never been more important to understand what’s happening in the world. Upgrade your access to exclusive content by &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;becoming a subscriber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The April meeting will permit Messrs. Trump and Xi to candidly discuss the South China Sea and Taiwan and ensure that there are guardrails to prevent conflict. Quiet and effective diplomacy is needed to address these issues, and the Trump – Xi meeting could establish the working groups and processes necessary to ensure the U.S. and China do not stumble into conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also important are the transnational issues that require the attention of the U.S. and China. This shouldn’t be too difficult, given the history of cooperation between the U.S. and China, primarily in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it was China’s Chairman Deng Xiaoping who approved cooperation with the U.S. on the collection and sharing of intelligence on the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China opposed the December 1979 Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan and worked with the U.S. to provide weapons and supplies to the resistance forces in Afghanistan – who eventually prevailed, with the Soviet Union admitting defeat and pulling out of Afghanistan in 1989. The war in Afghanistan cost the Soviet Union immense resources, lives and prestige, weakening the Soviet Union and contributing to its later dissolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 1979 normalization of relations, the U.S. and China cooperated on a few transnational issues: nuclear nonproliferation; counternarcotics, focusing on Southeast Asia’s Golden Triangle and the heroin from Burma going into China and the U.S.; counterterrorism and the sharing of intelligence on extremist networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, Secretary of State Colin Powell asked China to assist with the denuclearization of North Korea. The following year, China hosted the Six-Party Talks on North Korea’s nuclear program and actively assisted convincing North Korea, in the Joint Statement of September 19, 2005, to commit to complete and verifiable dismantlement of all nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China also cooperated with the U.S. on public health issues, like SARS and the avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooperation on these transnational issues was issue-specific, pragmatic, and often insulated from political tensions. Indeed, even during periods of rivalry, functional cooperation persisted when interests overlapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opportunities to Further Enhance Bilateral Cooperation for the Common Good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although U.S. – China cooperation on counternarcotics is ongoing, specifically regarding the fentanyl crisis, trafficking in cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines also requires close attention. More can be done to enhance bilateral efforts on nuclear nonproliferation, starting with China agreeing to have a dialogue with the U.S. on China’s ambitious nuclear program. Extremist militant groups like ISIS continue to be active, thus requiring better cooperation on counterterrorism. Covid-19 was a wakeup call: there needs to be meaningful cooperation on pandemics. And ensuring that the space domain is used only for peaceful purposes must be a priority, while also ensuring that there are acceptable guidelines for the lawful and moral use of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. – China cooperation today is more about preventing a catastrophe. The Belgrade Embassy bombing in 1999, when the U.S. accidentally bombed China’s embassy in Belgrade, killing three Chinese officials and the EP-3 incident of 2001, when a Chinese jet crashed into a U.S. reconnaissance plane, killing the Chinese pilot, and China detaining the U.S. crew in Hainan Island are two examples of incidents that could have spiraled out of control. Chinas initially refused to take the telephone calls from Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, both hoping to deescalate these tense developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

Stability in Northeast Asia and a nuclear North Korea, aligned with Russia and viewing the U.S. and South Korea as the enemies, should also be discussed, as well as nuclear nonproliferation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April summit between Messrs. Trump and Xi will be an opportunity to candidly discuss Taiwan and the South China Sea, to ensure we do not stumble into conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summit is also an opportunity to message to the world that the U.S. and China are working on a myriad of transnational issues for the common good of all countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The author is the former associate director of national intelligence.

      <title>The Biggest Questions About Venezuelan Oil</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have suggested that Donald Trump seized control of Venezuela’s oil reserves to boost profits for US refineries or to lower energy prices for American consumers by flooding the global market with crude. But this resource grab is most likely motivated by greed, as well as the desire to curb China’s access to energy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Coast Guard, Sovereignty, and Homeland Defense</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/coast-guard-sovereignty-and-homeland-defense</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION —&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. defense planning rests on the assumption that wars are fought abroad, by expeditionary forces, against defined adversaries. For decades, those assumptions held. But today, many of the most consequential security challenges facing the United States violate all three. They occur closer to home, below the threshold of armed conflict, and in domains where sovereignty is enforced incrementally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift has exposed a chronic mismatch between how the United States defines its defense priorities and how it allocates resources and respect. While defense discourse continues to stubbornly emphasize power projection and high-end conflict, many of today’s challenges revolve around the more modest and rote enforcement of U.S. territorial integrity and national sovereignty—functions that are vital to U.S. strategic objectives yet lack the optical prestige of winning wars abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the center of this gap between prestige and need is the U.S. Coast Guard, whose mission profile aligns directly with America’s most important strategic objectives—the enforcement of sovereignty and homeland defense—yet remains strategically undervalued because its work rarely resembles the celebrated and well-funded styles of conventional warfighting. In an era of increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/gray-zone-warfare&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;gray-zone&lt;/a&gt; competition and persistent coercion, the failure to properly appreciate the Coast Guard threatens real strategic fallout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third decade of the 21st century, U.S. defense planning remains heavily oriented toward expeditionary warfighting and high-end kinetic conflict. Budget conversations still revolve around Ford-class supercarriers, F-35 fighters, and A2/AD penetration. This orientation shapes not only force design and budget &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.usni.org/2026/01/15/billions-in-funding-helps-coast-guard-rapidly-implement-force-design-2028-modernization-efforts&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;allocations&lt;/a&gt;, but also institutional prestige and political capital. The services associated with visible combat power, with the Ford-class and the F-35, continue to dominate strategic discourse—even as many of the most persistent security challenges confronting the United States unfold close to home, in the gray-zone, without the need for fifth-generation air power or heavy armor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It’s never been more important to understand what’s happening in the world. Upgrade your access to exclusive content by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;becoming a subscriber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the most basic level, any nation’s military exists primarily to defend territorial integrity, enforce sovereignty, and protect the homeland. Power projection, forward presence, and deterrence abroad are important—but they are secondary functions derived from the primary purpose of homeland defense. Yet U.S. defense discourse often treats homeland defense as a background condition when it should be revered as the first priority. The result is a blind spot in how security resources are evaluated and allocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coast Guard operates at a unique point where law enforcement, military authority, and sovereign enforcement all converge. On any given day, the Coast Guard may board foreign-flagged vessels suspected of sanctions violations, police maritime borders against illicit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-u-s-coast-guards-quiet-drug-war-wins-amid-trumps-caribbean-strikes&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;trafficking&lt;/a&gt;, secure ports that underpin global supply chains, and maintain a persistent presence in contested spaces, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pacificarea.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/Arctic-District/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arctic&lt;/a&gt;, without inviting escalation. The Coast Guard is equipped to intercept illegal fishing fleets, escort commercial shipping through sensitive waterways, and assert jurisdiction in legally ambiguous areas. These activities rarely resemble traditional warfighting, they rarely result in a Hollywood blockbuster, and they can be accomplished without nuclear-powered submarines or intercontinental ballistic missiles. But these are not peripheral activities—they are arguably amongst the most important daily functions the U.S. military undertakes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinct among the military branches, the Coast Guard operates under a legal framework that is uniquely suited to today’s security environment. Under Title 14 status, the Coast Guard falls within the Department of Homeland Security, conducting law enforcement and regulatory missions on a daily basis. Yet, when needed, the service can transition to Title 10 status, under the Department of Defense, and operate as an armed service when required. This agility allows the Coast Guard to remain continuously engaged across the spectrum of competition, whether enforcing U.S. law in peacetime, managing escalation in gray-zone encounters, or integrating seamlessly into military operations. Few other elements of U.S. power can move so fluidly between legal regimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, despite such strategic relevance, the Coast Guard suffers from a persistent optical problem. U.S. defense culture has long privileged services and missions associated with visible, kinetic combat—those that lend themselves to clear narratives of victory, sacrifice, and heroism. The Coast Guard’s work rarely fits that cinematic mold. Its success is measured not in territory seized or targets destroyed, but in disruptions prevented, borders enforced, and crises that never materialize. Inherently quiet work with outcomes that reflect a force operating exactly as designed, although without generating institutional prestige or political support. In a system that rewards the loudest and the brightest, the Coast Guard’s quiet enforcement of sovereignty is easy to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

Specifically, persistent underinvestment in the Coast Guard weakens maritime domain awareness, reduces sustained presence in key waterways, and narrows the set of tools available to manage gray-zone competition. As adversaries increasingly rely on legal ambiguity, deniable actors, and incremental pressure to test U.S. resolve, gaps in enforcement become opportunities. In this environment, the absence of credible, continuous sovereignty enforcement invites probing behavior that becomes harder to deter over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocacy for the Coast Guard does not require reassigning prestige, or elevating one service at the expense of others. It is merely an argument for strategic alignment. If territorial integrity, sovereignty enforcement, and homeland defense are truly core national-security priorities, then the institutions most directly responsible for those missions should be treated accordingly. As competition increasingly unfolds in the gray-zone between peace and war, the United States will need forces designed not only to win conflicts—but to prevent them from starting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nicolás Maduro’s removal initially raised hopes that Venezuelans would finally regain control over their political future. Instead, US President Donald Trump has chosen to preserve the Chavista power structure, sidelining pro-democracy advocates and leaving opposition leader María Corina Machado with little influence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite political gridlock within countries and at global summits, climate change and ecological degradation are creating undeniable economic momentum. As renewables scale up, fossil fuels will become even less competitive; and as ecosystems degrade, markets will price in the risks and reward those who adapt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US Federal Reserve’s independence is widely understood to be vital to the economy’s well-being, by insulating monetary policy from political imperatives. But, following the launch of a criminal investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell by President Donald Trump’s minions at the Department of Justice, it is hanging on by a thread.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By capturing his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolás Maduro, US President Donald Trump sought to project power abroad but instead exposed his own political vulnerability. Despite his promises to restore Venezuela’s oil industry, his overt resource grab is far more likely to fuel regional turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Happens When Paid Work Disappears?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The rise of AI is disrupting labor markets at an unprecedented pace, driving down wages and eliminating entire professions faster than new ones can emerge. As data-based systems move into areas once viewed as exclusively human, societies must decide how to preserve dignity when full employment is no longer the norm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whereas the US Federal Reserve’s Marriner S. Eccles stood firm when President Harry Truman sought to finance the Korean War on the cheap, in 1971, Fed Chair Arthur Burns capitulated to pressure to keep interest rates low, fueling years of high inflation. Today's Fed should emulate Eccles – and so should the US Congress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far from being evidence of Donald Trump’s policy schizophrenia, recent developments reflect an administration-wide effort to restore the international order that prevailed before World War I, when America was more restrained in its global ambitions and more secure in its neighborhood. But the costs of such a shift could be profound.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Remembering Aldrich Ames and the Lives He Destroyed</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/remembering-aldrich-ames-and-the-lives-he-destroyed</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;“I would never wish death upon anyone, but I have read some obituaries with great satisfaction.” - Winston Churchill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION&lt;/strong&gt; -- I associate myself with at least the latter part of that quote from Winston Churchill with regard to Aldrich Ames. To my knowledge, I met Ames on only one occasion. It was during a cocktail party in 1989 or 1990 when he oversaw the CIA operations group responsible for what was then Czechoslovakia. I have no clear recollection of that event, but I was later told that fellow traitor Robert Hanssen was also in attendance. If so, to paraphrase Shakespeare: ‘Hell was empty and the devils were there’.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/feeds/feed.rss#_ftn1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I can recall little about meeting Ames at that party, my colleagues and I lived – and still live – with the consequences of his betrayal. The loss of an agent is a very personal thing for those responsible for securely handling him or her. I saw that impact up close early on in my career. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of my training as an operations officer in late 1982, I was summoned to the office of the then-chief of Soviet Division (SE). In that era, a summons to a meeting with any Division Chief - much less the head of what was then the most secretive operational component – could be unnerving for any junior officer. The initial moments of my appointment with then-C/SE, Dave Forden, were appropriately unsettling. He began by asking me whether I had stolen anything lately. Having never purloined anything ever, I was taken aback. After I answered no, he asked if I could pass a polygraph exam. Again surprised, I responded that I could the last time I took one. ‘Good’, Forden said, ‘you are coming to SE to replace Ed Howard in Moscow’. Howard, whom I had met during training, had been fired from CIA for a variety of offenses. He later defected to the USSR, betraying his knowledge of CIA operations and personnel to the KGB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing training, I reported to SE Division. Shortly thereafter, I was told I would not be going to Moscow after all. Instead, I was informed, I would be going to Prague. Initially, I was a bit disappointed not to have a chance to test my skills against our principal adversary. In hindsight, however, that change in plan was fortuitous. While I could not know it at the time, my SE colleagues who went to Moscow would be there during the grim mid-1980’s period in which our agents were being rolled-up by the KGB. Many CIA officers involved with those cases would have to live for years thereafter wondering what had happened to their agents and whether anything they had done had contributed to their arrests and executions. My colleagues’ ordeals would only end with the revelation that one of our own was a spy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ames was more than a spy. He was a killer. His career floundering and burdened by growing debt, Ames decided to solve his money problems by selling the identities of several low-level CIA agents to the KGB. Consequently, on April 16, 1985 he walked into the Soviet Embassy and passed on the following note: &quot;I am Aldrich H. Ames and my job is branch chief of Soviet (CI) at the CIA. […] I need $50,000 and in exchange for the money, here is information about three agents we are developing in the Soviet Union right now.” He attached a page from SE Division's phone list, with his name underlined, to prove he was genuine. Within weeks, fearful that Soviet spy John Walker had been fingered by a CIA agent within the KGB, and worried that he might likewise be exposed, Ames decided to comprise all of the CIA and FBI Soviet sources he knew of. “My scam,” he later said, “was supposed to be a one-time hit. I was just going to get the fifty thousand dollars and be done with it, but now I started to panic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It’s never been more important to understand what’s happening in the world. Upgrade your access to exclusive content by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;becoming a subscriber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, on June 13, 1985, Ames passed the Soviets what he called “the Big Dump.” That tranche of documents contained the identities of at least 11 CIA agents. Brave men who had risked all in deciding to serve freedom’s cause, many of them would be arrested, interrogated and ultimately executed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ames’s rationalization of this act says everything about the kind of man he was. “All of the people whose names were on my list knew the risks they were taking when they began spying for the CIA and FBI,” he said, before adding that, &quot;They knew they were risking prison or death.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He would repeatedly seek to justify his actions by claiming that his espionage for the USSR was morally equivalent to what Western services had long done against their adversaries. Oleg Gordievsky, a British spy within the KGB and one of the few agents betrayed by Ames who escaped, rightly rejected any such equivalency. &quot;I knew,” he said, that “the people I identified would be arrested and put in prison. Ames knew the people he identified would be arrested and shot. That is one of the differences between us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentenced to prison, Ames would spend almost 32 years of his life behind bars. I like to think that punishment was worse than death. One hopes he whiled away hours in his cell thinking of what he’d done and the lives he took. He expressed contrition during the plea bargain and sentencing process to ensure leniency for his wife, Rosario, saying, for example, that, &quot;No punishment by this court can balance or ease the profound shame and guilt I bear.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I very much doubt the sincerity of such statements because he showed no signs of having a troubled conscience thereafter. Instead, in statements while incarcerated, Ames was at pains to give his actions a veneer of ideological justification. &quot;I had,” he said, “come to believe that the espionage business, as carried out by the CIA and a few other American agencies, was and is a self-serving sham, carried out by careerist bureaucrats who have managed to deceive several generations of American policy makers and the public about both the necessity and the value of their work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is an actuarial certainty that there are other spies in U.S. national security agencies and there always will be.” That statement by former CIA Chief of Counterintelligence Paul Redmond in the wake of the Ames and Hanssen cases reflects a grim reality of the intelligence profession. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, when I joined CIA, it was accepted wisdom that the Agency had never had, and could never have, a spy in its ranks. With the benefit of hindsight, it is hard to understand how such a naïve conviction could have taken hold given the repeated penetration of our predecessor organization, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and our British counterparts by Soviet intelligence. “There will,” as CIA Chief of CI James J. Angleton said, “always be penetrations…it is a way of life. It should never be thought of as an aberration. Anyone who gets flustered is in the wrong business.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the downplaying of such a possibility was a natural reaction to the overreach of Angleton himself with his ‘HONETOL’ spy hunts which hindered the Agency’s ability to mount operations against the Soviets for years at the height of the Cold War. It was certainly a reflection of institutional arrogance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason, the idea that a foreign intelligence service could recruit a serving CIA officer as a spy was inconceivable to many. That mindset makes the accomplishment of Redmond and the Agency team led by Jeanne Vertefeuille, concluding that reporting from a Soviet mole – ultimately determined to be CIA officer Aldrich Ames – was the cause of the losses, all the more remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

The assessment of the damage that Ames had inflicted on U.S. national security in exchange for some $2.5 million from Moscow was, not surprisingly, extensive. Even in the analogue era, he was able to pass along voluminous documentary and oral reporting to Moscow. This included reporting on his own debriefing of Vitaliy Yurchenko, who defected briefly to U.S. before returning to the USSR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was the review of Ames’s role in compromising our courageous agents that struck home with us. Their sacrifice is commemorated by the CIA ‘Fallen Agent Memorial’ and other memorials within Agency spaces. And one hopes that someday the Russian people, too, will come to realize that Military/Technical researcher&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Adolf G. Tolkachev (GTVANQUISH); KGB Line PR officer Vladimir M. Piguzov (GTJOGGER); KGB Line PR officer Leonid G. Poleschuk (GTWEIGH); GRU officer Vladimir M. Vasilyev (GTACCORD); GRU officer Gennadiy A.

Polyakov (TOPHAT, BOURBON and ROAM); sacrificed everything for them and for their country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The life of the dead,” Marcus Tullius Cicero wrote, “is placed in the memory of the living.” For my part, I will remember Ames as the base traitor he was and the men he killed as the heroes they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>Ruling Venezuela with a 2,000 Mile Hammer is Not Likely to End Well</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-ruling-2000-mile-hammer</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT OPINION —&lt;/strong&gt; Rule by proxy just isn’t as simple as the Trump Administration wants to make it sound. While the long-term goals of the Administration in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/after-maduro-us-test-venezuela&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; are unclear, the tools they appear to want to use are not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the Administration seems to want to dictate policy to the Delcy Rodriguez government through threats of force, which President Trump recently highlighted by suggesting that he had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/09/politics/trump-venezuela-second-strike-cancel-intl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;called off&lt;/a&gt; a second strike on Venezuela because the regime was cooperating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the Trump Administration has stated that it will control the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuelas-key-takeaways&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;oil sales&lt;/a&gt; “indefinitely” to, in the words of the Secretary of Energy, “drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the legality and morality of using threats of armed force to seize another country’s natural resources and dictate an unspecified set of “changes”, this sort of rule from a distance is unlikely to work out as intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, attempting to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-now-the-hard-part&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;work through the Venezuelan regime&lt;/a&gt; will drive a number of choices that the Administration does not appear to have thought through. Propping up an authoritarian regime that is deeply corrupt, violent, and wildly unpopular will over time increasingly alienate the majority of the Venezuelan people and undermine international legitimacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regime leaders, and the upper echelons of their subordinates, are themselves unlikely to quietly depart power or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/us-run-venezuela&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; itself without substantial guarantees of immunity and probably wealth somewhere else. Absent that, they will have every incentive to throw sand in the works of any sort of process of political transition. Yet facilitating their escape from punishment for their crimes with some amount of their ill-gotten gains is unlikely to be acceptable to the majority of the Venezuelan people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elements of the regime have already taken steps to crack down on opposition in the streets. The Trump Administration is going to decide how much of this sort of repression is acceptable. Too much tolerance of repression will harm the already-thin legitimacy of this policy, particularly among the Venezuelan people, the rest of the hemisphere, and those allies the Administration hasn’t managed to alienate. Too little tolerance will encourage street protests and potentially anti-regime violence and threaten regime stability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Some parts of the Rodriguez government will want to crack down on her supporters and make their lives as difficult as possible. The Trump Administration is going to have to think hard about how to react to that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tools of violence from a distance, or even abductions by Delta Force from over the horizon, are not well calibrated to deal with these dilemmas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Venezuelan regime appears to be heavily factionalized and punishing Delcy Rodriguez, which President Trump has threatened, could benefit other factions, for example, the Minister of the Interior or the Minister of Defense, both allegedly her rivals for power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless the Administration can count on perfect intelligence about what faction is responsible for each disfavored action and precisely and directly respond, we are likely to see different factions, and even elements of the opposition, undertake “false flag” activity intended to cause the U.S. to strike their rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actions to punish or compel the regime also run the risk of collateral damage, in particular civilian casualties which will undermine support for U.S. policy both in Venezuela and abroad and potentially bolster support for the regime. And intelligence on the ground is not going to be perfect and airstrikes or raids will almost certainly cause collateral damage despite the incredible capabilities of the U.S. intelligence community and the U.S. military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

Utilizing the Venezuelan government to distribute proceeds from oil sales is just a way of ensuring that regime elites continue to siphon off cash or use that money to reward their followers, punish their opponents, or coopt potential rivals by buying them off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the U.S. could, in fact, somehow track the vast majority of the funds from oil sales and ensure that they are not misused, this would again undermine the unity and inner workings of a regime built on buying off factions and elites. That would likely encourage those factions to find other ways of extracting funds—for example, increased facilitation of drug shipments or shakedowns of local firms supporting the reconstruction of the oil sector. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the U.S. is not at all likely to have a granular view of what happens to that money. The U.S. intelligence community, while capable of a great many things, cannot track where most of these funds go or who is raking off how much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Iraq and Afghanistan, where the U.S. had tens of thousands of soldiers, spies, advisors, and bureaucrats and was directly funding large parts of those governments, staggering levels of corruption existed and at times, helped fund warlords and faction leaders who undermined stability. We even managed to fund our adversaries at times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Venezuela, by contrast, we might have an embassy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless the problem of how to monitor where the money goes can be solved, the U.S. will be supporting and funding a corrupt regime that feathers its own nest and undermines the transition to democracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruling from a distance, or even trying to force a political transition from a distance, drives a number of choices that the Administration clearly hasn’t thought through. And the tools the Administration is choosing to use; force from over the horizon and the control over the flow of some funds, aren’t matched well enough or sufficiently nuanced to accomplish the ends they claim to want to achieve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that, it’s unlikely this will end well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>The Reality is that Russia is Signaling Minimal Desire for Peace</title>

In the capital, Kyiv, residents are facing temperatures as low as 10 degrees farenheit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/major-russian-strike-targets-ukraines-power-grid-in-freezing-temperatures&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;without electricity or water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 30, 2025, Moscow claimed a Ukrainian drone attack targeted Russian President Vladimir Putin's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/29/europe/russia-claim-ukrainian-drone-attack-putin-residence-intl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;residence&lt;/a&gt;. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov threatened his country's military would launch &quot;retaliatory strikes&quot; and said Moscow's &quot;negotiating position will be revised” in ongoing talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected the claimed drone attack as “a complete fabrication”, and sources say the CIA assessed that Ukraine was not targeting the Russian leader's residence in the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump said in December that the U.S. was “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-meet-trump-florida-talks-ukraine-peace-plan-2025-12-28/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;very close&lt;/a&gt;” to a deal. So, what's happening?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the latest push for peace, Russia seems to conveniently reset the clock, demanding further talks as it continues its bombardments and assaults across Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This Russian strike sends an extremely clear signal about Russia’s priorities,” Zelensky said in a post &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/2003378962714497042&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; referring to a strike on December 23 that killed three people and injured 12. Zeleneky condemned the attack “ahead of Christmas, when people simply want to be with their families, at home, and safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That strike came just days after Putin told Russian defense ministry officials that Moscow will persist in its mission to “liberate its historic lands” and achieve its war goals “&lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/in-further-disregard-for-peace-putin-calls-european-leaders-little-pigs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;unconditionally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” — by negotiations for an agreement in Moscow’s favor, or through continued war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The continued Russian attacks and Putin’s bellicose language underscore a pattern that has defined Russia’s position on “peace” throughout its full-scale invasion of Ukraine: not budging from maximalist demands, blaming Kyiv for the lack of progress, and leveraging Western fears of escalation to World War Three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardline from Putin comes as Ukraine has offered significant concessions, including Ukraine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-demands-dignified-peace-us-ukraine-officials-meet-berlin-2025-12-14/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;dropping NATO membership ambitions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for at least the time being, as well as a potential withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the east and the creation of a demilitarized “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;free economic zone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” The latest reports say Russia still wants more, including more stringent restrictions on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-24/russia-to-demand-changes-to-us-peace-plan-seen-as-starting-point?srnd=homepage-americas&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;size of Ukraine’s military&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Ukrainians have been saying for over a year that they are ready to come to an agreement. They are ready to be realistic and compromise,” Glenn Corn, a former senior CIA Officer told &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s the Russians that are not doing that. It’s the Russians that continue to push maximalist demands and that continue to scuttle the peace process — not the Ukrainians.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the eyes of seasoned intelligence professionals who have studied Putin's actions for decades, the continued attacks despite peace talks are hardly surprising. “Putin has never been sincere about a negotiated solution to his ‘Special Military Operation,’” said Rob Dannenberg, former Chief of CIA’s Central Eurasia Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia is also continuing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0k4389g2o&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;offensive pushes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on multiple fronts, including in the regions it claimed to annex - Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk, where the embattled strategic city of Pokrovsk is - as well as in the northern Kharkiv region. Experts warn Putin’s ambitions go far beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We've got Putin on the other side of it and the reality is he has not taken one single step towards a temporary ceasefire or a peace deal whatsoever,” General Jack Keane (Ret.), who served as Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army and is a trusted advisor to President Donald Trump, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Where he is, he still believes that eventually he's going to break the will and resolve of the United States and the Europeans and the Zelensky government and he will eventually have his way here,” Keane said, adding that Putin’s ultimate war goal is to “topple the government of Ukraine and expand into Eastern Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

The pattern was visible in Georgia in 2008 and again in Crimea in 2014, when Moscow signaled willingness to talk even as it consolidated military gains on the ground, buying time and weakening Western responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always use the example of Syria during the Civil War when they [Russian forces] were killing members of the Syrian opposition while they were drinking wine and coffee with American and European interlocutors in Europe, claiming that they were trying to find an agreement,” Corn told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, behind any Russian statement of openness to engagement and dialogue, Putin has continued to assert that Ukraine is part of Russia, that the government of Zelensky is illegitimate, and that Russian forces can achieve victory on the battlefield to justify his stonewalling — despite mounting costs for Russia and limited territorial gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“Putin’s strategy has been consistent: advance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-narratives-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;false narratives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; adopt a non-negotiable maximalist position and make ever-increasing demands for concessions; take deliberate actions to erode U.S., Ukrainian, and NATO resolve and perceived options; employ implicit and explicit threats and intimidation; and offer false choices,” former CIA Senior Executive Dave Pitts&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Taken together, these represent Russian ‘reflexive control’—a subset of cognitive warfare and a strategy designed to persuade adversaries to voluntarily adopt outcomes favorable to Russia,” Pitts told us. “In the face of unreasonable sovereignty and territorial demands placed on Ukraine and none placed on Russia, an emboldened and confident Putin will now likely demand even more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Hesitant West&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did we get here? Some experts say a long-running pattern of Western hesitation in keeping Russia in check has emboldened Moscow. It’s not hard to remember that at the start of the full-scale invasion, Western countries were slow to provide full military support to Ukraine, concerned about a possible wider escalation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retired General Philip Breedlove, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/breedlove-middle-east-ukraine-authoritarians&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “We have taken precious little action to stop the fight in Ukraine and we still find ourselves saying, ‘We're not going to do that because we've got to give peace a chance and we don't want to escalate the problem.’ And that formula is not working now and has not worked for 11 years.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have virtually enabled the Russian war on Ukraine by our lack of action in a more severe way. Many of us from military backgrounds say that we have built sanctuary for Russia. From that sanctuary, we allow them to attack Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that while the goal should be, as President Donald Trump has said, “to stop the killing,” awarding concessions to a Kremlin that has yet to drop its maximalist war aims is not the solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Trump Administration’s desire to end the violence in Ukraine is commendable, but not at the price of setting the stage for the next war by giving victory to the aggressor,” Dannenberg told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-peace-deal&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With peace talks ongoing, it is proving difficult to come up with a deal that does not force Ukraine to give too much while ensuring the proposal does not push Russia to reject the deal outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beyond the negotiating table, experts say there are ways to pressure Putin to peace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is not waiting, continuing strikes on Russian energy infrastructure to curb energy export revenues that fund Moscow’s war machine, and bringing the cost of the war back to ordinary Russians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the U.S. and Europe, major sanctions on Russia - including new measures against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/do-oil-sanctions-still-work&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Russian oil giants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Rosneft and Lukoil - are already in place and reportedly starting to take their toll, but experts say stronger enforcement is needed to make them truly bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining military aid to Ukraine is also essential. In mid-December, Congress passed a defense bill that authorizes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-congress-passes-massive-defense-bill-that-includes-support-ukraine-europe-2025-12-17/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;$800 million for Ukraine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - $400 million in each of the next two years - as part of the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which pays U.S. companies to produce weapons for Ukraine's military. President Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/trump-ndaa-military-spending&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;signed the measure into law&lt;/a&gt; on December 18. Meanwhile, while Europeans failed to agree to use frozen Russian assets to back a loan for Ukraine, the EU agreed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/12/23/exclusive-how-the-deal-to-get-ukraine-a-90-billion-eu-loan-was-sealed&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;90 billion euro loan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the next two years, backed by the bloc’s budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Trump Administration should demonstrate its displeasure at Russia’s clear disregard for any so-called peace process by fully enforcing all existing sanctions, providing Ukraine with long-range weapons, and declaring that peace negotiations are suspended until Russia demonstrates it is serious about these negotiations,&quot; General Ben Hodges, former Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe, told &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;. &quot;Otherwise, the President’s efforts and those of his negotiators are clearly a waste of time and headed nowhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European countries have also fortified post-war pledges to Ukraine. Britain and France have committed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17zee20qpzo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sending troops&lt;/a&gt; to a peacekeeping mission -- if a peace deal is reached. Experts U.S. intelligence, command and control, and logistics support is needed to give any European effort credibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact will be felt far beyond Ukraine, and long after the guns there go silent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the United States, the best outcome will come from taking the longer, harder road that denies any reward for Russia’s illegal invasion, forces Putin to make reasonable concessions, and sustains the long-term sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,” Pitts said. “That longer, harder road also leads to stronger U.S. national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vladimir Putin also appeared to reject any progress in ceasefire discussions. “The strategic initiative is completely &lt;a href=&quot;https://semafor.com/s/o4pNCpPAYG?email=emasucol@thecipherbrief.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;in the hands of the Russian forces,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Putin said that Russia is facing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/putin-admits-russia-faces-gas-shortage-amid-ukraines-strikes-on-energy-infrastructure/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gas shortage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While he did not say why, the comment notably came amid Ukraine’s campaign to target Russian refineries, pipelines and other energy infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what could be seen as tacit support for Ukraine’s tactic, the Trump administration recently approved an $825 million sale of extended-range missiles to Ukraine. The State Department said this includes 3,350 &lt;a href=&quot;https://aviationweek.com/defense/missile-defense-weapons/us-innovation-hurries-new-cruise-missile-ukraine&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ERAM missiles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which have a range of 250 miles, and 3,350 GPS units, missile containers, and other necessary equipment. The package is funded via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_237131.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;financing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;some help&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from U.S. foreign military financing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, there is stalwart support for Ukraine, with around 26 countries of the so-called Coalition of the Willing committing last week to sending troops to Ukraine or training the Ukrainian military to help guarantee Ukraine’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-witkoff-europe-61ae60275a00cb442c743181df13b785&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;postwar security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, of course, there is the option for the U.S. to act on its threat of sanctions if Russia does not move to an equitable peace deal. President Trump said on Sunday he is ready to move to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-ready-phase-two-russia-sanctions-over-ukraine-conflict-2025-09-07/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;second phase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of sanctions on Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. President has threatened Russia with ‘crushing’ sanctions. But Putin played ‘rope-a-dope’ and instead got a summit and postponement of sanctions for his efforts,” Dannenberg said. “President Trump has now set another deadline. The time for deadlines is over. It is time for action. … Let Ukraine take the war to the Russian Federation and make it visible to the people of Russia what is happening. If Putin doesn’t like it, let him end the war and withdraw from Ukrainian territory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Such killings now, when real diplomacy could have already begun long ago, are a deliberate crime and a prolongation of the war,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on social media after the latest Kyiv strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mounting Frustration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;President Trump has expressed frustration with this charade from the Kremlin, especially given his investment in efforts to broker a peace deal. The U.S. President has complained that he is “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/russias-largest-drone-attack-yet-hits-ukraine-government-building-4e3e46d4?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgmZUuKDUlv7RNaF5WdtLC5o3pi80OQ7eE_4JFmCs9sizo496xuhQTnrl92Ogs%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=68bdb7fb&amp;amp;gaa_sig=thIkQFWy26_u46aZW3ZQ6ovaIk1DwWYgJP2soa4mnbhmTcojk1NYSoRt7VhZG7uYcrEFQd9yaKJs3uYonpEWkQ%3D%3D&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;very disappointed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;” in Putin since he “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/video/trump-says-putin-talks-nice-and-then-he-bombs-everybody-b085000bd3bb4847837a5349204a7315&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;talks nice and then he bombs everybody&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;After the August 28 strikes on Kyiv, White House press secretary &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Karoline Leavitt &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;said Trump “was &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/28/trump-shrugs-off-russias-assault-on-kyiv-and-europes-outrage-00534585&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;not happy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt; about this move, but he was also not surprised.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leavitt noted: “These are two countries that have been at war for a very long time. Russia launched this attack on Kyiv, and likewise, Ukraine recently dealt a blow to Russia’s oil refineries.” That was in reference to the recent spate of Ukrainian drone attacks at Russian &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/27/frustrated-russians-grapple-with-fuel-crisis-as-ukraine-attacks-oil-refineries&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;oil and gas infrastructure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. The difference there, experts say, is that Ukraine is targeting energy infrastructure to curb the revenues of Russia’s energy exports, which fuel its war machine. Russia has been striking Ukrainian infrastructure throughout the war, in addition to bombing Ukrainian civilians.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia on Sunday struck Ukraine with the largest aerial assault of the war so far. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched over 800 drones and fired 13 missiles in the attack, marking the most drones used against Ukraine in a single night. The bombardment killed at least five people across Ukraine and struck a landmark government building in Kyiv, Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers, for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This attack is just the latest in a series of Russian assaults. On August 28, Russian drones and missiles &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-attack-23e051f1b7e93308f99b6fdfdd8949f2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;leveled a residential tower&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3y7m2gz0o&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;damaged European Union diplomatic offices&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Kyiv. Attacks in previous days destroyed &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/explosions-rock-ukrainian-cities-as-russia-again-launches-large-scale-attack/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;energy infrastructure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; across Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia has pushed further on the frontlines, entering the central Dnipropetrovsk region for the first time in the war. Russian Defense Minister &lt;strong&gt;Andrei Belousov &lt;/strong&gt;claimed that the Russian army has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-defence-minister-says-his-forces-have-sped-up-rate-their-advance-ukraine-2025-08-29/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;accelerated its rate of advance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relentless assault is nothing new to Ukraine, but what makes the most recent attacks stand out is that they come amid a major U.S. and European push for peace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 16, President Trump hosted Putin in Alaska to discuss how to end the fighting.

He considers Ukraine part of Russia and Zelensky illegitimate. So with whom should he negotiate in his mind? Putin is even less inclined to negotiate since he has come to believe (incorrectly in my view) that he can win the war militarily. He allows the pretense of negotiation to create confusion and distraction in supporters of Ukraine in the West. Thereby, delaying military and economic support for Ukraine. By and large this strategy has worked thus far. Anchorage and its aftermath should have provided clarity that Putin is insincere about negotiations with Ukraine. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RALPH GOFF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The increased intensity of Russia strikes on cities across Ukraine - the Ukrainians recorded nearly 600 drones and 31 missiles of various types during the night of 27-28 August - clearly indicate Vladimir Putin has no real interest in agreeing to a ceasefire at present. Meanwhile, Russian ground forces literally inching their way forward in numerous sectors of the front- albeit at tremendous human cost - reportedly now of over 1,000,000 Russian soldiers killed, captured or seriously wounded ( by comparison around 15,000 Soviet Soldiers were killed in a decade of war in Afghanistan) - clearly indicate that Putin is not overly concerned with losses to Russia. Thus, it's hard to predict where Putin is going with this. At best he is &quot; softening up&quot; the Ukrainian people so that they will be increasingly eager for a settlement - any settlement - to the war. At worst he is firmly set on destroying Ukraine militarily, economically and politically no matter the cost. Meanwhile, neither the US administration nor our European Allies have developed and presented a cogent strategy for either continuing the war or seeking an armistice. Putin, who has never really been held accountable by any US administration or by the Europeans , has no real reason to stop at this time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLEN CORN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They will continue to launch strikes, try and take territory while they're going to a negotiation negotiating table. So they've done that. The tactic they've used in the past, and I always use the example of Syria during the Civil War when they were killing members of the Syrian opposition while they were drinking wine and coffee with American and European interlocutors in Europe, claiming that they were trying to find an agreement.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damage to Ukraine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United Nations currently estimates that as of 31 December 2024, the total cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine is $524 billion (€506 billion) over the next decade, which is approximately 2.8 times the estimated nominal GDP of Ukraine for 2024.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/02/25/updated-ukraine-recovery-and-reconstruction-needs-assessment-released?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/02/25/updated-ukraine-recovery-and-reconstruction-needs-assessment-released?utm_source=chatgpt.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/10/concern-ukraine-will-be-split-up-reconstruction-talks?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/10/concern-ukraine-will-be-split-up-reconstruction-talks?utm_source=chatgpt.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than three years into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the war has already inflicted over $175 billion in direct damage to the country’s buildings and infrastructure, according to the latest estimates from the World Bank. This marks a $23 billion increase in damage compared to the previous year’s assessment. The data comes from the fourth Ukraine Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA4), which covers the period from February 24, 2022, to December 31, 2024.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/chart/34614/estimated-cost-of-direct-war-damage-in-ukraine/?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.statista.com/chart/34614/estimated-cost-of-direct-war-damage-in-ukraine/?utm_source=chatgpt.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part of problem: Western inaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breedlove&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remain deterred. In the press you hear people talking about this war being three and a half years long. This war is over 11 years long. It started in the spring of '14 when I was still serving as the Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, and it hasn't stopped. It was hot for a few years and then it went warm. Russians were killing Ukrainians and Ukrainians were killing Russians on the line of contact. And then, after some six years or so of that warm war on the line of contact, Russia re-invaded, and I call this the third phase of the 11-year-long war.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This war has covered four presidents, Obama, Trump twice and Biden once, and all four of them have been nearly and completely deterred from the very beginning. We, as we always do in the military, offered options for how to address this conflict in Ukraine back in 2014. And the answer was, &quot;We're not going to take any action because the war will escalate if we take action.&quot; Well, we gave them options from very small movements to larger more bellicose movements, they chose none of them and here we are. What we do know is we did not take action for fear of escalation. We were deterred and we didn't take action and Russia escalated anyway. And so our lack of action ended up in the escalation of the problem by the Russians. And that has repeated itself through four administrations for the past 11 years. We are still deterred. We have taken precious little action to stop the fight in Ukraine and we still find ourselves saying, &quot;We're not going to do that because we've got to give peace a chance and we don't want to escalate the problem.&quot; And that formula is not working now and has not worked for 11 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have virtually enabled the Russian war on Ukraine by our lack of action in a more severe way. Many of us from military backgrounds say that we have built sanctuary for Russia. From that sanctuary, we allow them to attack Ukraine. If you can think of a map, up in the northwest corner of the map is Belarus all the way to the east around through Russia all the way to the south, into the Black Sea and west across the Black Sea. We have allowed Russia to attack Ukraine from nearly 300 degrees on the map, and we still cannot determine that we should allow Ukraine to fire back deeply into Russia with our kit.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution: pressure on Russia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;““So what does this mean for the US and for Europe? I think this now, it's just a sign that, I mean, I've said this before, I've written it. I give President Trump a lot of credit for trying to find a solution for this very serious problem. But I think now is the time where the only thing that Putin is going to understand, and the only way that he will stop doing what he's doing is if he feels pain.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“He understands that there is a serious consequence for him and the people around him for what he is doing, and the only thing that's going to make him be anything close to sincere is when he understands that he's dealing with interlocutors that are very serious and that are willing to stand up and respond forcefully for this type of aggressive action, which is insulting to those people, including our president, who have tried to negotiate a ceasefire and a peace agreement.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanctions, ukraine air defenses, kick out children of russian oligarchs studying in us, london, paris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DANNENBERG:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The U.S. President has threatened Russia with “crushing” sanctions. But Putin played “rope-a-dope” and instead got a summit and postponement of sanctions for his efforts. President Trump has now set another deadline. The time for deadlines is over. It is time for action. The only path that has not been tried (but has only been threatened) is to put maximum pressure on Putin and the Russian Federation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how we get there: first, the President should immediately authorize the advancement of pending legislation in the U.S. Congress on sanctions on Russia and purchasers of Russian hydrocarbon products.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, the President should use his authority to advance the sale or “lend lease” of military support for Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, the U.S. should remove any restrictions on Ukrainian use of weapons systems already provided or already committed to help Ukraine defend itself. Let Ukraine take the war to the Russian Federation and make it visible to the people of Russia what is happening. If Putin doesn’t like it, let him end the war and withdraw from Ukrainian territory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And fourth, the U.S. should restore maximum diplomatic isolation of Russia and publicly call out Russia as the aggressor in this conflict.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this context, the success President Trump had ending the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict should be leveraged to reduce Russian influence in the Republic of Georgia, long a bastion of pro-U.S. sentiment but recently put under a cloud of Russian interference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let the loss of influence in the Caucasus be added to the list of Putin’s strategic failures. Put it on the list right next to Finland and Sweden joining NATO.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanctions alone won’t influence Putin, but sanctions, renewed military and financial support for Ukraine, renewed diplomatic isolation, and strategic leverage on Russia’s periphery might.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The path ahead should be clear to the U.S. President, who must now know that he can’t trust Putin. The Russian president is the enemy of the U.S. in every fiber of his being and it’s time for him to pay the price of his folly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breedlove&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanctions have never changed Putin's actions on the battlefield. Sanctions have hurt Russia. Sanctions have hurt the Russian people. Sanctions have hurt the Russian economy. All those things are true, but they have never changed Russian actions on the battlefield. And so, we either need to double and triple the really crushing sanctions and take all of the frozen Russian money and use it to help Ukraine. We've got to physically stop the Russian shadow fleet from moving oil around the world. There's a whole host of things we could do that would truly bring Russia to their knees and we haven't done it.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note on security guarantees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breedlove: “It's a confusing issue about what America is going to do or not do in any possible peace-enforcement capacity. The best move right now, not under a NATO hat, because clearly, Mr. Putin believes he's in charge and he said there will be no NATO involvement, but if NATO or European Union nations were to volunteer for a coalition of the willing presence in Ukraine, then that's what, I think, needs to happen. We need the big nations- the UK, the French, the Germans, to step up but they're waiting and watching for American leadership. Is America going to be that backbone and offer what the president talked about in his post-talk news conference and so forth? We need for all of that to happen. We need for America to make a decision to supply air power, command and control, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, et cetera, those non-boots on the ground capabilities. And then, we need the European nations who've already intimated they may be willing to provide boots on the ground to get in there and get a stoppage of the fighting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Putin’s entire objective however is to keep kicking the can to the right, run right up to the red line, wave a bright shiny object, get another red line, run right up to the red line, wave another shiny object, get another deadline. He is very good and has had great success at moving our red lines to the right.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FROM THE UKRAINIAN EMBASSY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the night of August 28 (starting from 19:30 on August 27), the enemy launched a massive strike on the territory of Ukraine using attack UAVs, air-launched and ground-launched missiles – a total of &lt;strong&gt;629 aerial attack assets&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;598 Shahed-type attack UAVs&lt;/strong&gt; and decoy drones of various types launched from Kursk, Bryansk, Millerovo, Orel, Shatalovo, Primorsko-Akhtarsk (Russia), and Hvardiiske (temporarily occupied Crimea);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Kh-47M2 &quot;Kinzhal&quot; aero-ballistic missiles&lt;/strong&gt; from the airspace of Lipetsk and Voronezh regions (Russia);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles&lt;/strong&gt; from Bryansk and Voronezh regions (Russia);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 Kh-101 cruise missiles&lt;/strong&gt; from the airspace of Saratov region (Russia).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;main target of the Russian strike was Kyiv&lt;/strong&gt;, where the majority of drones and missiles were directed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Odesa region, due to missile threats and the “transit” flight of Shahed groups, the first air raid alert lasted from &lt;strong&gt;23:00 to 01:18&lt;/strong&gt;. The second alert was from &lt;strong&gt;03:52 to 06:02&lt;/strong&gt; – exactly when the Russians launched aero-ballistic, ballistic, and cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to preliminary data, as of 09:00, Ukrainian air defense forces shot down/suppressed &lt;strong&gt;589 aerial targets&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;563 Shahed-type UAVs&lt;/strong&gt; and decoy drones of various types;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Kh-47M2 &quot;Kinzhal&quot; aero-ballistic missile&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 Kh-101 cruise missiles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall effectiveness of air defense is estimated at &lt;strong&gt;approximately 93%&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Against Shaheds – &lt;strong&gt;94%&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overall against missiles – &lt;strong&gt;83%&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Against cruise missiles – &lt;strong&gt;90%&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Against ballistic and aero-ballistic missiles – &lt;strong&gt;72%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy on “X”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as our people are dealing with the consequences of one of the most large-scale Russian terrorist attacks, we see yet another attempt by Hungarian officials to portray black as white and to shift the blame for the ongoing war onto Ukraine. In Ukraine, we responded positively to all proposals from the world regarding a ceasefire and real diplomacy, and the only one who rebuffed them was Russia. Unfortunately, there has still been no fair reaction from Hungary to such behavior by Russia. Nor has there even been sympathy expressed over the deaths of our people – just last night alone, in Kyiv, Russian drones and missiles took the lives of 17 people, including 4 children. Yet every day we hear new accusations against Ukraine coming from Hungary. Hungarian officials have gone so far as to attempt to discriminate against members of the Hungarian community in Ukraine for their participation in the defense of our state and our people. If Hungary has indeed closed entry into Hungary and the entire Schengen zone to one of Ukraine’s military commanders, who is an ethnic Hungarian and a citizen of Ukraine, this can only cause outrage. I have instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to clarify all the facts and respond accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1961047854639935814&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1961047854639935814&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now in Kyiv, first responders are clearing the rubble of an ordinary residential building after a Russian strike. Another massive attack against our cities and communities. Killings again. Tragically, at least 8 people have already been confirmed dead. One of them is a child. My condolences to all their families and loved ones. People may still be trapped under the rubble. Dozens are wounded. These Russian missiles and attack drones today are a clear response to everyone in the world who, for weeks and months, has been calling for a ceasefire and for real diplomacy. Russia chooses ballistics instead of the negotiating table. It chooses to continue killing instead of ending the war. And this means that Russia still does not fear the consequences. Russia still takes advantage of the fact that at least part of the world turns a blind eye to murdered children and seeks excuses for Putin. We expect a reaction from China to what is going on. China has repeatedly called for not expanding the war and for a ceasefire. Yet this is not happening because of Russia. We expect a reaction from Hungary. The death of children should definitely stir far greater emotions than anything else. We expect a response from everyone in the world who has called for peace but now more often stays silent rather than taking principled positions. And it is definitely time for new, tough sanctions against Russia for everything it is doing. All deadlines have already been broken, dozens of opportunities for diplomacy ruined. Russia must feel accountable for every strike, for every day of this war. Eternal memory to all victims of Russia!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1960934028321685907&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1960934028321685907&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prime minister of Ukraine Yulia Svyrydenko on “X”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of now, already 14 people are known to have been killed as a result of the Russian attack, including 3 children. The horrific and deliberate killing of civilians, again. The Russians are not choosing to end the war, only constant expansion of atrocities. Overnight in Kyiv, dozens of buildings were hit: residential houses, office centers, civilian enterprises. Among them also the building where the European Union Delegation to Ukraine is located. Russians now believe that they have paralyzed Ukraine's allies with feigned plans for &quot;negotiations&quot; and endless delays that only serve as methods to buy time with the true goal only of preventing sanctions. It is crucial now that the world responds firmly. Russia must be stopped. New and stronger sanctions are needed. The Russians understand only strength and pressure. For every strike, Moscow must feel the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/Svyrydenko_Y/status/1960995612989563198&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/Svyrydenko_Y/status/1960995612989563198&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/u&gt;There are currently over 500 rescue workers and 1,000 police officers engaged in rescue efforts across Kyiv in the aftermath of yet another brutal Russian missile and drone attack on our capital city. With the possibility that the death toll may still rise, there are already at least 8 confirmed dead – among them 1 kid – and dozens injured after an assault that lasted more than nine hours. Russians targeted residential buildings, shopping areas, a school: purely civilian targets. Russia has merely used the good intentions of Ukraine's allies to buy more time, to expand the killing – simply mass murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/Svyrydenko_Y/status/1960936422937858118&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/Svyrydenko_Y/status/1960936422937858118&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Andrii Sybiha on “X”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the barbaric Russian strike on the Ukrainian capital, it was important to visit, together with heads of 55 foreign diplomatic missions, the site of one of the strikes, a ruined residential building in the Darnytskyi district. This is a site of a horrible war crime. At least 14 innocent civilians were killed by Russian terrorists here, including four children. One of the kids was born under Russian strikes in 2022 and killed by the Russian strike this morning. I am grateful to my colleague, Minister of Internal Affairs Igor Klymenko, who briefed foreign diplomats on the casualties and recovery efforts. It is critical that the world sees Russian terror and takes action to stop this barbarism. I thank all foreign diplomats who joined us today in commemorating the victims of Russian strikes. Russia is a terrorist state. We count on strong international responses and action to increase pressure on Russia, including new tough sanctions, and strengthen support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1961010371046834689&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1961010371046834689&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We insist on strong international reactions to Russia’s brutal strike on Kyiv and other cities. Russia killed at least 8 people, including a child, and targeted civilian infrastructure. Whatever Putin said in Alaska, his real actions reject diplomacy, dialogue, and peace efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1960945855780765705&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1960945855780765705&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a residential home in Kyiv ruined by Russia. People may still be under the rubble. This horrific sight proves that Putin will only stop when faced with pressure and strength. We urge public condemnation and action: new sanctions on Russia and strengthening for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1960945881366098006&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1960945881366098006&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak on “X”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything you need to know about the terrorist state, Putin, and their so-called “desire” for peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/AndriyYermak/status/1960894814313992619&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/AndriyYermak/status/1960894814313992619&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyiv city center. Ordinary residential buildings were damaged as a result of a Russian attack on the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/AndriyYermak/status/1960981276703236533&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/AndriyYermak/status/1960981276703236533&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kyiv, Russia has already killed 15 people, including 4 children. &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/AndriyYermak/status/1961014915176505695&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/AndriyYermak/status/1961014915176505695&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statement of the UCCRO on the latest Russian terrorist attacks against Ukrainian cities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the night of August 27–28, 2025, the Russian state once again launched terrorist attacks against the cities of Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, and other Ukrainian towns. As a result of missile and drone strikes, civilians — including children — were killed and wounded. Residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, including a kindergarten, were destroyed or damaged; hundreds of people lost their homes, and thousands of Ukrainians endured the terror of nighttime assaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dictatorial Russian regime has once again exposed its inhumane nature and its criminal, genocidal policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We strongly condemn the latest terrorist attacks carried out by the Russian Federation against Ukrainian cities and villages, which once again confirm its nature as a terrorist state. Any support now extended to the Russian Federation is, in fact, support for murderers and criminals, and carries with it undeniable moral responsibility. Money earned through business with Russia today is stained with the blood of innocent victims, and that blood cries out to Heaven for just retribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We extend our deepest condolences to the families of the victims and pray for all those who have suffered at the hands of Russian terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also take this opportunity to express our profound gratitude to all religious leaders, believers of different denominations, and people of goodwill for their unwavering support of the Ukrainian people, for their prayers for an end to Russian military aggression, and for their commitment to the establishment of a just and lasting peace for Ukraine and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vrciro.ua/en/statements/statement-by-the-ukrainian-council-of-churches-and-religious-organizations-on-the-latest-russian-terrorist-attacks-against-ukrainian-cities&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://vrciro.ua/en/statements/statement-by-the-ukrainian-council-of-churches-and-religious-organizations-on-the-latest-russian-terrorist-attacks-against-ukrainian-cities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNITED24 Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;«Russian forces deliberately targeted a residential building with a &quot;doube-tap&quot; strike during the latest attack, CCTV footage shows.
