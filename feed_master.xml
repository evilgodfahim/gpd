      <title>A Blueprint for Next-Generation Defense Production</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/blueprint-next-generation-defense-production</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;The Pentagon’s push to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5595767-pentagon-overhaul-weapons-acquisition/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;overhaul&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; its slow, specification-driven &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/defense-acquisition-arsenal-freedom&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;procurement system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an overdue acknowledgment that our defense industrial base has become too narrow, too fragile, and too dependent on foreign supply chains. America’s defense establishment is finally waking up to a critical weakness that has metastasized in recent decades: we have drifted away from the industrial might that once formed the bedrock of our economy and allowed us to out-produce any adversary in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are many warning signs, one symptom of the problem is unmistakably clear: the United States is not producing what it needs at the speed and scale modern conflict demands. Recent reporting shows the U.S. Army is still struggling to meet its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2025/8/14/army-falls-short-of-155mm-production-goal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;155mm artillery-shell production goals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after years of effort. Across the spectrum—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fpri.org/article/2025/10/americas-scale-problem/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;from advanced missile interceptors to something as basic as black powder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—we are falling dangerously behind in both production capacity and supply-chain resilience. For now, these shortfalls are appearing in conflicts that don’t directly involve American troops, but the truth is that a major war will see the United States forced to ration materials and munitions, deploying untested prototypes on the battlefield while the defense industrial base races to catch up. We must act now to prevent this from happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we are serious about winning the next war—or better yet, deter it—we must &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/defense-acquisition-pentagon-steve-blank&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;rethink&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; both how we buy military equipment and weapons, and how fast we can make them. We don’t need another half measure or a fully government solution. Instead, the government should leverage the private sector to build a nationwide network of multifaceted, resilient manufacturing nodes that can surge production of everything from drones, vehicles, and body armor to medicine, munitions, and microelectronics in times of crisis, while sustaining production lines for commercial products in peacetime. The power of the U.S. economy can, and should, be leveraged to solve this problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This network of production centers, or campuses, would bring together startups and established manufacturers in the same ecosystem, enabling the kind of rapid prototyping, pilot production, and full-rate manufacturing the Pentagon is urgently seeking. Each of these campuses would be designed for flexibility, with modular production capabilities that can be rapidly upgraded, and shared heavy infrastructure such as test beds, utilities, and analytical systems. Furthermore, these facilities would be part of a connected national network, leveraging the regional strengths of each part of the country while avoiding the single points of failure commonly found in today’s highly concentrated manufacturing hubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

Major firms are often tied up maintaining legacy systems while cash-strapped startups cannot afford to build compliant, capital-intensive factories without production contracts. These startups are often told that contracts won’t come until they prove they can manufacture at scale. So promising technologies stall in a chicken-or-egg limbo while delays snowball. The Pentagon’s renewed embrace of OTAs helps, but money alone won’t fix a physical bottleneck. We need places where cutting-edge firms can scale quickly, and affordably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A national network of industrial campuses is designed to fill this gap. Under this model, companies wouldn’t pay construction costs up front; lease payments would begin only after they move in and start generating revenue. Layering into the model a certain number of shared facilities—initially funded by the Pentagon—would reduce risk, accelerate development, and dramatically shorten production timelines. Young companies gain room to grow. Established firms gain access to fresh innovation - and taxpayer dollars go further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a radical idea. It is an evolution of the model that once made America unstoppable. In World War II, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.war.gov/News/Feature-Stories/story/Article/2128446/during-wwii-industries-transitioned-from-peacetime-to-wartime-production/#:~:text=The%20Mattatuck%20Manufacturing%20Company%2C%20which,Production%20Poster&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;factories across the economy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—automotive, textile, consumer goods, and more—transformed to support the war effort. That surge capacity happened because the United States had an existing industrial ecosystem ready to mobilize. Today, we no longer have one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades of offshoring, consolidation, and a fixation on short-term efficiency have left our industrial base &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-9/forty-years-of-falling-manufacturing-employment.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;brittle and full of holes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. COVID-19 made that painfully clear when the world’s largest economy found itself &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/2024/07/how-the-us-gained-and-then-lost-the-ability-to-make-medical-masks/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;dependent on foreign suppliers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for PPE and basic supplies. Semiconductor shortages still slow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/05/27/1101701890/javelin-missiles-are-in-short-supply-and-restocking-them-won-t-be-easy&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;defense&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/cars/news/2025/10/31/automaker-disruptions-chips-crisis/87012992007/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;automotive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lines. Meanwhile, our adversaries are turning basic industries into warfighting assets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thedefensepost.com/2024/01/11/russian-bakery-drones-ukraine/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Russian bakeries are producing drones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/china-navy-fujian-sichuan&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;China&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is treating its manufacturing capabilities as a strategic weapon while in America, we’ve been treating our manufacturing base like an accounting exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Manufacturing is a strategic asset—every bit as important as ships, planes, satellites, or submarines. Washington should fund shared industrial infrastructure, de-risk private investment, and let market forces drive efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The math is simple. In some cases, companies piloting these programs have delivered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.war.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3143134/defense-department-launches-innovative-manufacturing-pilot-program/#:~:text=Copy%20Link,chemical%20manufacturing%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Dr.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;4:1 to 25:1 returns on tax dollars&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, generating major gains for minimal government investments. With a defense budget exceeding $800 billion, the Pentagon can easily afford to invest a sliver of that—well under one percent—to send a clear, unambiguous demand signal to the private sector that America is rebuilding its industrial backbone, and doing it now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History shows what happens when we do. Modest seed capital during World War II and the Apollo program unlocked massive private investment and generated hundreds of innovations that have come to define the modern age. These campuses would be more than factories—they would be hubs where manufacturers, universities, investors, and federal partners build self-sustaining ecosystems capable of accelerating innovation, fostering talent, and producing critical goods at scale. They would restore American industrial depth, innovation, and flexibility—our most reliable, most underestimated tools of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America is racing into the next &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/atlantic-council-strategy-paper-series/welcome-to-2035/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;complex era of great-power competition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a defense industrial base limping along from the last era; one that is simply too small, too fragile, and too slow. We can invent extraordinary technologies, but what use are they sitting in a lab if we can’t produce them at scale? If that doesn’t change, the United States risks discovering—too late—that innovation without industrial power is a hollow advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding American manufacturing will be difficult. But the cost of inaction is far higher. A nation with a deep, flexible industrial base can surge production, absorb economic shocks, and outlast any adversary, on the battlefield and the home front. A nation without one is forced to ration weapons, delay deployments, and scramble to keep its supply chains functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can build this network now or we can wait for a crisis to expose, once again, how fragile our industrial base has become. In the next conflict, the world’s strongest military must be able to depend on its factories to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>2025: 10 Events That Changed the World</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/2025-10-events-change-world</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/u-s-secretary-of-defense-pete-hegseth-gives-address-at-the-2025-reagan-national-defense-forum.jpg?id=62609682&amp;amp;width=1200&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPECIAL REPORT — &lt;/strong&gt;In a turbulent year, one of the biggest national security stories came in the form of a document.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Security Strategy (NSS)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, released earlier this month, upends longstanding U.S. policy toward allies and adversaries alike. It ranks drug trafficking and illegal immigration as top threats to U.S. security, places a heavy emphasis on the Western Hemisphere, criticizes Europe and downplays security challenges from China and Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight years ago, Trump's &lt;a href=&quot;https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;first NSS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said that “China and Russia challenge American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity.” The new NSS doesn’t name Russia as a threat to the U.S. – stating instead that “strategic stability with Russia” is a goal of American policy. Europe is presented as a bigger challenge; the U.S. should “help Europe correct its current trajectory,” which the NSS says has been damaged by immigration and a risk of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-warns-europe-faces-civilizational-erasure/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;civilizational erasure&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for China, the document focuses on economic competition – trade, infrastructure, and technology. References to Taiwan and the South China Sea come later, and they include warnings that other Asian nations must carry a greater burden; “the American military cannot, and should not have to, do this alone.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The north star of great-power competition with China and Russia—around which the first Trump administration built bipartisan consensus—is gone,” Rebecca Lissner, Senior Fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/unpacking-trump-twist-national-security-strategy&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the new NSS. The objective now, she said, is a “mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, European leaders were furious about the pivot to a more Russia-friendly posture, and what the European Council President called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://semafor.com/s/TMzbyGfQP2?email=tgnagorski@gmail.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;political interference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” in the affairs of Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glenn Corn, a former CIA Senior Executive, called the document’s treatment of Europe a “shock.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Europeans are not the enemy,” Corn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-winter-coming&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;“And I doubt the Russians will stand side by side with us on the battlefield and support us the way that our European partners have done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new NSS won praise from at least one global capital. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/china/kremlin-says-new-us-security-strategy-accords-largely-with-russias-view-2025-12-07/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; its emphasis on restoring strategic stability with Moscow “correspond in many ways” to Russia’s own vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;eb939&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=62609698&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infographic with a map of the Americas showing the areas where the United States has carried out attacks against alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean since September 2, 2025, as well as the number of people killed in these attacks, as of December 16 (Graphic by AFP via Getty Images)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missiles on the Water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;While the focus on narcotrafficking was clear from the early days of Trump’s second term, the heavy U.S. military deployments and air strikes in the Caribbean took experts by surprise. The aerial campaign began with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/boat-strike-survivors-hegseth-congress-legal-details-ce16f4740841b2b5f2904588335a818e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;September missile attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a small boat that killed 11 people; a second strike that day took the lives of two survivors who were clinging to the upturned vessel. The follow-on strike sparked criticism in Congress – including from Republicans – and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/are-deadly-us-strikes-alleged-drug-vessels-legal-2025-10-31/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;charges&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it might have violated maritime laws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of mid-December, at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/us-military-says-new-strikes-3-suspected-drug-boats-killed-8-board-rcna249433&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;25 strikes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had followed, including some in the Pacific, resulting in the deaths of more than 90 people alleged to have been smuggling drugs on the water. The Trump administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-maduro-drugs-venezuela-911-hegseth-3db3aafed492556bb9ca7de855c4849e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;justified the attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as necessary to stem a flow of fentanyl – which Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-venezuela-drug-war-fentanyl-weapon-b2885056.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;labeled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “a weapon of mass destruction” that has killed tens of thousands of Americans. Legal experts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/us/politics/trump-drug-cartels-war.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;questioned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whether passengers in these boats — even if they were found to have been carrying narcotics — could be considered enemy combatants. Others &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/DEA_GOV_DIR-008-20%20Fentanyl%20Flow%20in%20the%20United%20States_0.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;noted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that fentanyl and its precursors are sourced primarily from China and Mexico — not Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate question loomed, as the year wound down: were the strikes a prelude to military action against Venezuela, and its president, Nicolas Maduro? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the U.S. military buildup, there were several signs in December that a move against Venezuela may be in the offing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/politics/trump-plans-after-maduro&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the U.S. was exploring “day-after” scenarios in the event of Maduro’s ouster; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-administration-seizes-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast-us-officials-say-2025-12-10/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;seizure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of a Venezuelan tanker that was said to be transporting sanctioned oil to Iran; and President Trump’s December 16 announcement of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-orders-blockade-sanctioned-oil-tankers-leaving-entering-venezuela-2025-12-16/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;naval blockade&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of sanctioned oil tankers from Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;“Maduro has become the epicenter for a range of activities the U.S. is determined to roll back,” Ambassador Patrick Duddy, Former U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-caribbean-us-military-buildup&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; “Seizure of the oil tanker signals that the U.S. has decided to take more active measures to achieve its goals.&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;95a09&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=62609704&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infographic with a map showing the location of strikes carried by Israel against Iran since June 13, 2025, according to data reported by the ISW (Graphic by AFP) (Graphic by VALENTINA BRESCHI,SYLVIE HUSSON,OLIVIA BUGAULT/AFP via Getty Images)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The U.S. and Israel Attack Iran&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It would have been unthinkable only two years ago: a U.S.-Israeli war against Iran that provoked almost no meaningful response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/israeli-airstrikes-iran&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; came in June – Israeli strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and military infrastructure that were followed by American airstrikes on three nuclear installations. Iran &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/explosions-heard-in-qatar-home-to-u-s-airbase-amid-iranian-threats-to-retaliate-for-strike-on-nuclear-sites&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fired missiles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at a U.S. base in Qatar but its overall retaliation was minimal, a consequence of earlier Israeli campaigns that weakened Iranian air defenses and its various militias in the Middle East. The 12-day war damaged elements of Iran’s nuclear program and laid bare a tectonic shift in the region: Iran and its “axis of resistance” had been badly weakened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, war-gaming scenarios had warned that any attack against Iran would carry risks of a conflagration, given the likelihood of a coordinated response from Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthi militia in Yemen. Now the paradigm has shifted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. joined Israel in military operations and people thought that had been a red line in the past,” Norman Roule, a former National Intelligence Manager for Iran at ODNI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-middle-east-is-reshuffling-the-deck&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;“For the nuclear negotiations and other talks going forward, Iran now has to deal with a new world where there is this precedent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the year ended, Iran remained a shell of what it had been, and reports suggested its leaders were conflicted about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jstreet.org/iran-policy-memo-what-comes-next/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;way forward&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Would the country recognize its weaknesses and move towards a rapprochement with the West — a move that might bring sanctions relief and usher in a new security dynamic in the region? Or would hardliners carry the day, resorting to one of the last levers Iran has – its nuclear program?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you're in Iran, you have to make a strategic decision,” Roule said. “‘If we restart the program, will the United States and Israel attack?’ They've got to ask, ‘If we do this, will we survive?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;09f7a&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=60322255&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office at the White House on February 28, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zelensky’s Oval Office Blowup – and the Rollercoaster that Followed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, 2025 brought wild swings of fortune, on the battlefield and in the global halls of power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Oval Office meeting on February 28 marked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-ukraine-war-just-got-uglier-and-even-more-personal&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;low point&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – the encounter during which President Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky for what they saw as insufficient gratitude towards the U.S. and – in Trump’s words – a failure to understand that Ukraine “has no cards” in the war against Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting “was a horrible disappointment and almost a shock to the system,” former NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Philip Breedlove &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-ukraine-war-just-got-uglier-and-even-more-personal&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told us&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that day. “There was only one winner…and that is Vladimir Putin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But fortune’s wheel took turns in Zelensky’s favor. Trump’s subsequent meetings with Zelensky – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/face-to-face-at-the-vatican-how-trump-and-zelensky-made-up-344cb932?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcAnV09NdNoLfkepp3_RxRIXacMpzvQ2cyXmLyejRdFBEZJIWbWw7IETAPrqa0%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=6942dcc4&amp;amp;gaa_sig=0AVPrf7HwUsUC-ZDOcU0PSz8pETWLEn_w2DV_LmQ1r4LP5RjL-Fbh-bLsYtbb2WgArvkh9UDac029VPJhM3GYA%3D%3D&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;at the Vatican&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in April and the June &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/trump-meets-with-zelenskyy-at-nato-summit-says-ukraine-war-is-a-mess-for-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;NATO summit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – warmed the relationship; the NATO summit itself saw Trump pivot back toward the alliance and its support for Ukraine; and then – in a startling outburst – Trump in July &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2025/07/08/trump-putin-bullshit-sanctions-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;turned his ire&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; towards Russian President Vladimir Putin. “We get a lot of bull**** thrown at us by Putin,” Trump said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alas for Zelensky, at year’s end the pendulum looked to have swung back once more. Trump’s envoys were again pushing Russia-friendly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-winter-coming&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;peace proposals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which included the surrender of territory beyond what Russia has already occupied. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/trumps-frustration-with-ukraine-and-europe-boils-over-00683676&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Trump said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Zelensky, “He’s gonna have to get on the ball and start accepting things…cause he’s losing.” It sounded like a gentler version of the treatment Zelensky had gotten on that February day in the Oval Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;6c453&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=60355928&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;small class=&quot;image-media media-photo-credit&quot;&gt;            Photo by Wojtek Laski/Getty Images        &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Tu-95 bomber aircraft takes off for a night patrol flies out of Engels-2 airbase on August 7, 2008 in Engels, Russia.

An operation dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-attack-operation-spiderweb-24d821ab?mod=hp_lead_pos5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“Spiderweb”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; smuggled 117 drone weapons into Russia and unleashed them against several airfields on June 1, damaging or destroying dozens of Russian warplanes. The mission was months in the planning, the drones were smuggled on prefabricated cabins disguised as hunting lodges, and unsuspecting Russians were paid to drive the trucks that moved the cabins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Spiderweb” showcased Ukraine's special operations capabilities and was followed by more long-range sabotage.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;As &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-attack-on-russian-oil&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, subsequent attacks targeted Russian refineries and other sites tied to the oil sector. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very impressive,” Balazs Jarabik, a former European Union diplomat and analyst for &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;RPolitik, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The energy-sector attacks, he said, were “making the Russian war effort more expensive, and creating shortages so the Russian people feel the pain of the war.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By year’s end, Ukraine had carried out an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-nearly-160-russian-oil-facilities-in-2025-sbu-says//?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;160 strikes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Russia’s oil sector – the campaign &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-reportedly-target-oil-infrastructure-in-siberia-over-2000-km-away-from-frontline/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reached&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as far as the Siberian city of Tyumen, some 1200 miles east of Moscow, and included &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-sbu-conducts-new-sea-baby-drone-strike-on-russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-in-black-sea-source-says/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;strikes against vessels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; alleged to be working in Russia’s so-called &quot;shadow fleet” of tankers carrying sanctioned oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ukraine’s theory of victory now includes destroying Russia’s energy sector,” Lt.

But that may have been the easy part. As the year drew to a close, there were sporadic breaks in the ceasefire, and the fate of the deal’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/whats-next-gaza-ceasefire-will-truce-last-2025-12-17/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;next phases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70155nked7o&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;plan for Gaza&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; included the deployment of an international stabilization force and creation of an international “Board of Peace” (led by Trump himself) to oversee the implementation of the next phases – the transition of governance to Palestinians not affiliated with Hamas, and the beginning of a multi-billion-dollar reconstruction. The deal also included language offering a conditional pathway to Palestinian autonomy over its territories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as of mid-December, the announcement of the Board had been delayed, and the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/13/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-plans-postwar.html?searchResultPosition=2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that while the U.S. was pressing other nations to contribute troops to a 8,000-member force for Gaza, it had yet to win any commitments. Countries were said to be worried their troops might be ensnared in fresh fighting; and the UN Security Council &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/world/middleeast/un-security-council-gaza-peace-plan.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;resolution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to deploy the force gave no precise terms of engagement. Nor was there agreement on the makeup of a transitional government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these hurdles appeared, reports suggested Hamas was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/world/middleeast/hamas-gaza.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;rebuilding its presence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the territory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Who’s really calling the shots there?” Ralph Goff, a former CIA Senior Executive, asked at &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; annual Threat Conference, speaking of the uncertainty inside Gaza&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;“I remain pretty pessimistic on the idea of any kind of internal governing force being able to compete with Hamas at this point.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By year’s end, two things were clear: the Gaza ceasefire itself was a welcome achievement after two years of carnage; and uncertainty hung over the truce’s critical next phases. This was one major story that will continue to unfold — with hope but also apprehension — well into 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;2556a&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=62282654&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The commissioning and flag-presenting ceremony of the Fujian, China's first aircraft carrier equipped with electromagnetic catapults, is held at a naval port in Sanya City, south China's Hainan Province, on Nov. 5, 2025.

It was a fitting symbol for a year in which China turbocharged its military buildup.&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/chinas-leap-forward-drone-weapons&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, China took a “leap forward” in drone weaponry in 2025: a huge new “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3336520/chinas-latest-stealth-endurance-drone-ch-7-completes-maiden-flight&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;stealth endurance drone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” mosquito-sized &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3315206/chinese-military-robotics-lab-creates-mosquito-sized-microdrone-covert-operations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“micro drones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” and the deployment of a new “&lt;a href=&quot;http://v&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;drone mothership&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” The latter, known as the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jiu Tian,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was billed as the world’s largest drone carrier – an 11-ton aircraft that is itself an uncrewed aerial vehicle. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3310879/china-extend-combat-range-uavs-jiu-tian-drone-carrier-prepares-first-mission?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;amp;pgtype=article&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jiu Tian &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;can hold 100 smaller UAVs and carry them more than 4,000 miles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They have the production, they have large inventory and now they also have the AI,” Dr. Michael Raska, a professor at the Military Transformation Programme at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/chinas-leap-forward-drone-weapons&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “With all these combined, they have been experiencing a leap forward in the quality and quantity of all their drones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China also made leaps in maritime power. In November, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.usni.org/2025/11/07/china-comissions-3rd-aircraft-carrier-fujian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;commissioned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the 80,000-ton &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fujian, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;the country’s third aircraft carrier and largest to date. A week later came &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.naval-technology.com/news/analysis-what-we-know-about-the-sichuan-chinas-drone-carrier-hybrid/?cf-view&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;news that&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sichuan, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;one of the world’s largest amphibious assault ships, would be ready for deployment next year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retired Rear Admiral Mike Studeman, a former Commander of the Office of Naval Intelligence,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/china-navy-fujian-sichuan&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;that China had achieved its longstanding goal of building “a world-class Navy,” which had surpassed the size of the U.S. fleet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's not just not in the numbers, it's in the quality,” RADM Studeman said. “These ships are modern by any standard.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's impressive,” another former Rear Admiral, Mark Montgomery, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/china-navy-fujian-sichuan&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “They're building a hundred merchant ships for every one we build, and two warships for every one we build.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump Administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-americas-maritime-dominance/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;issued&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an executive order in April to jumpstart the U.S. shipbuilding industry and restore “American maritime dominance,” but experts said the U.S. faces an uphill road. As &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reported, China is on track to have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/ship-wars-confronting-chinas-dual-use-shipbuilding-empire&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;425-ship fleet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by 2030, while the U.S. Navy currently has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/RL32665#:~:text=The%20Navy%20fell%20below%20300,included%20296%20battle%20force%20ships.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fewer than 300&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deployable battle-force vessels – a total which may drop as aging ships are retired faster than new ones are put to water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;6a855&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=62303368&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Police cars are seen on November 17, 2025 close to the railways that were damaged in an explosion on the rail line in Mika, next to Garwolin, central Poland, after the line presumably was targeted in a sabotage act. (Photo by Wojtek Radwanski/AFP via Getty Images)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Europe Wakes Up to the “Gray-Zone” War&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2025 was the year when Europe formally recognized – and began to respond to – a growing threat from the east: the so-called “gray-zone” war attributed to Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These attacks mushroomed in 2025 – from cyberattacks to railway bombings, the cutting of undersea cables to drone incursions into Poland and the Baltic states, and more. Experts said they were designed to be difficult to trace, and non-kinetic, so as not to draw a military response; as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-sabotage-shadow-war&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported, the Kremlin was likely “aiming to create disruption without triggering escalation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there were also signs that European leaders were waking up to the gravity of the threat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NATO’s Secretary General Mark Rutte &lt;a href=&quot;http://v&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;warned repeatedly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the dangers, and the alliance moved to improve detection and deterrence measures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nations took steps of their own. Finland &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/finland-steps-up-anti-drone-defences-amid-concerns-about-russia-2025-12-09/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;acquired&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of drone jammers and outfitted border forces with high-end drone detectors; leaders from Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltic states &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/czech-president-pavel-says-europe-may-need-to-shoot-down-russian-aircraft-drones-violating-nato-airspace/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they might shoot down Russian aircraft if Moscow continued its provocations; in a September speech to the United Nations, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski went so far as to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/radoslaw-sikorski-poland-russia-un-security-council-nato/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;warn Moscow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “if another missile or aircraft enters our space without permission, deliberately or by mistake, and gets shot down and the wreckage falls on NATO territory, please don’t come here to whine about it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even nations far from the Russian frontier were waking up to the dangers; Ireland &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/ireland-unveils-euro-1-7-billion-plan-beef-up-weak-defenses/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;unveiled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a €1.7 billion, five-year defense plan that included systems to counter drones and protect undersea cables from Russian sabotage. And in her first public speech, MI6 chief Blaise Metreweli described the gray-zone threat bluntly: “The new frontline is everywhere,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/15/world/europe/uk-mi6-russia-chaos.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;she said. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;former Senior CIA Executive Dave Pitts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/gray-zone-warfare&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;stressed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the need “to change the risk calculation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to think of deterrence and response as a team sport - an Article 5 mindset,” Pitts wrote. “Gray-zone attacks that go unanswered reward our adversaries and reinforce the idea that there are more gains than risk…and encourage more attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p rel=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

(Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;America’s Rare Earth Crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, rare earth minerals rarely made global headlines. 2025 was the year when that changed. And for the U.S. government, it was also the year in which rare earths took center stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two basic facts underscored the urgency: rare earths are essential building blocks for everything from smart phones to home appliances to cars to all manner of military equipment and weapon systems; and China now produces an estimated 60 percent of the world’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-chinas-ban-rare-earths-processing-technology-exports-means?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; rare earths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and processes nearly 90 percent of them. The U.S. Geological Survey &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/the-pentagons-rare-earth-problem-is-a-china-problem-too&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that in 2024, the U.S. imported more than 95 percent of the total rare earths that it consumed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those realities spurred multiple U.S. efforts to change the dynamic: deals with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/10/united-states-australia-framework-for-securing-of-supply-in-the-mining-and-processing-of-critical-minerals-and-rare-earths/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Australia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://click.e.economist.com/?qs=9079e7399bd317c2cfd3baae3033852b32590721b7f84655629b584c1e3e5191c5d44d4d9a3bde9083dfde80ee777a3cf99b0b6186caf19ef2d67e88b1105cb9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Japan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; negotiations with other resource-rich countries, including Congo, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Malaysia; and threats to annex mineral-rich &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20251104-the-story-behind-the-scramble-for-greenlands-rare-earths&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greenland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Even the negotiations with Russia and Ukraine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/u-s-blueprint-to-rewire-economies-of-russia-ukraine-sets-off-clash-with-europe-72484515?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfc3gSk0w0_92NUFsVZbzbgo4gaQPaMc2Y5JEJEZTTWRCkSkSQ7wVFGFvuX8ek%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=694197a3&amp;amp;gaa_sig=I9naj79PLuhyrTwrEhQyujRt0p9ugV5-5PwrhmiUIh53v6S25ntaDcIPCdABYqFh_fi24bd9Gv7V-B-koPYV8w%3D%3D&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reportedly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; included plans for U.S. firms to invest in rare-earth extraction in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China’s imposition of rare-earth export &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-rare-earth-and-magnet-restrictions-threaten-us-defense-supply-chains&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;restrictions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; only heightened the concerns – and while those were lifted as part of a deal with Washington, the message was clear: China’s rare-earths dominance now poses a huge problem for the U.S., and gives China a powerful lever in any future negotiations with Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Miller, a Former Assistant Director of the CIA’s China Mission Center, called the rare earth access “vital” to U.S. technology and national security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We democracies must do more to assure we have continuous access to these metals, and we also need to start producing more,” Miller told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “All democracies must focus on this issue; we must act now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;Intel Chiefs Detail Top Threats \u2013 and Get a Grilling Over Signal Leak&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;bd782&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/intel-chiefs-detail-top-threats-u2013-and-get-a-grilling-over-signal-leak.jpg?id=60322271&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then-National Security Agency Director General Timothy Haugh, FBI Director Kash Patel, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe, and then-Defense Intelligence Agency Director Jeffrey Kruse appear during a Senate Committee on Intelligence Hearing on March 25, 2025 in Washington, DC.

Roughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2025/08/20/odni_20_with_trumps_greenlight_gabbard_launches_historic_intelligence_overhaul__153198.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;40% of ODNI staff&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were cut, including the elimination or consolidation of the Foreign Malign Influence Center and some cyber threat units into other agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other high-level dismissals drew particular attention: National Intelligence Council acting head Mike Collins &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5298799-gabbard-fires-national-intelligence-council-leaders/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;was fired&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after presenting an assessment on Venezuela that contradicted the White House line; and NSA Director Gen.

Jon Darby, a longtime NSA veteran who served as director of operations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/abrupt-changes-at-the-top-of-the-national-security-agency-risk-destabilization&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; he was “very disheartened” by Gen. Haugh’s ouster. “We need an explanation of the underlying rationale,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beth Sanner, a &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; expert who served as Deputy Director for National Intelligence at ODNI, warned of a broader politicization of the IC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The intelligence community is not like asking people to hit the easy button and the ‘I agree with you’ button,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-presidents-daily-brief-no-assembly-required&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;she said.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “That's not our role. Our role is to say what we think and why we think it…The intelligence community isn't always right. But when done correctly and behind closed doors, I cannot understand why anybody would say that presenting an intelligence assessment that disagreed with policy needed to stop, or was an example of deep state. It's not. And it's really important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that said, the nature of the IC makes it difficult, even at the end of a tumultuous year for the various agencies, to know precisely what the impact of the “overhaul” has been – or will be in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;812fe&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=61620478&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fingers on laptop. (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Cybersecurity “Watershed” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed like a headline from a science fiction journal. An artificial intelligence system had conducted a large-scale espionage operation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t science fiction – or fake news. The AI giant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anthropic confirmed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the first real-world case of the use of an AI system to do exactly that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today marks a watershed in cybersecurity,” Jennifer Ewbank, a former Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency for Digital Innovation, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “AI has now crossed from tool to operator,” Ewbank said, “blurring the line between human intent and machine execution...a threshold has been crossed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic said that Chinese state-sponsored hackers had exploited its Claude AI system to carry out cyberattacks on corporations and foreign governments in September, and that the hackers had succeeded with only minimal human oversight. Anthropic’s threat intelligence chief &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the campaign had targeted about 30 entities, and represented a new level of AI-enabled hacking. The hackers posed as security auditors and successfully breached several systems, accessing privileged accounts and private data before being blocked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? The number of breaches and scale of the damage appeared small, and no U.S. government agencies were compromised. But the incident gave ammunition to doomsayers who have warned of AI nightmares – and showed that AI is already a valuable tool for hackers and state-backed cyber operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts called it the latest code-red warning for securing AI systems and deploying effective cyber defenses. As Ewbank put it, “This is no longer a hypothetical threat being researched in a lab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The AI Diffusion Challenge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While investors seem, by and large, to be betting on a massive payoff from today's AI spending, some predict that the technology will fall short of expectations, leading to a bust. Who turns out to be right will depend far more on diffusion than on frontier development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump recently threatened to take military action against Nigeria to save Christians from a “genocide.” Trump has three possible motives for making such a threat: his mercantilist quest for rare-earth minerals, his pandering to evangelical Christians, and his racist grievances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US government’s new global health strategy calls for shifting 270,000 frontline health-care workers from US-funded NGO programs to recipient government payrolls.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite strong opposition in Congress, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has launched an ambitious industrial policy aimed at boosting renewable-energy capacity and expanding domestic defense capabilities.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under President Donald Trump, the United States is seeking to create a world order based solely on spheres of interest controlled by the US, China, and Russia. And because this will require breaking up the European Union, the decades-long transatlantic alliance has given way to enmity in remarkably short order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given the Trump administration’s recent statements and policy pronouncements, European leaders no longer have any excuse for failing to map out their own long-term security strategy. If they can get their act together on ending the Ukraine war, they will gain a much stronger position on other key fronts, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Next Nuclear Proliferation Crisis Is Already Here</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/nuclear-proliferation-crisis</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly threatened that Russia might use nuclear weapons if its sovereignty or territory is threatened, as it enters the fourth year in its war of aggression in Ukraine. The Russian Federation has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2024-12/news/russia-revises-nuclear-use-doctrine&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;revised its nuclear doctrine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and lowered the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. And given the lethality of nuclear weapons, the use of nuclear weapons in any large-scale exchanges would kill tens or hundreds of millions of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1963 Cuban missile crisis brought us close to a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. It was the basis for President John F. Kennedy’s concern that more countries with nuclear weapons would create an unstable world with nuclear war more likely. President Kennedy feared that by 1970 there may be 10 nuclear powers instead of the four – the U.S. Soviet Union, United Kingdom and France – and by 1975 there could be as many as 10 or 20 nuclear weapons states. It would be “the greatest possible danger and hazard to contemplate – a nuclear arms race on a multipolar basis.” President Kennedy’s concerns are the concerns &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/nuclear-golden-dome-missile-defense&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;we have today&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with the prospect of a nuclear arms race in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/will-anything-stop-iran-s-pursuit-of-nuclear-weapons&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Middle East&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/north-korea&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;East Asia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cuban missile crisis contributed to several arms control efforts, like the Limited Test Ban Treaty (1963) banning atmospheric and underwater tests and the creation of the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Indeed, the NPT established a global framework for the 190-member counties to stop non-nuclear states from getting nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are now nine nuclear weapons states and concern that more countries will seek the resources necessary to produce their own nuclear weapons or to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In East Asia, North Korea has increased its stockpile of nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles to deliver these weapons of mass destruction. The Korea Institute for Defense Analysis recently publicly stated that North Korea has between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10625110&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;127 and 150 nuclear weapons&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and by 2030 they will have 200 nuclear weapons. And given the likely assistance North Korea is receiving from Russia with its nuclear and missile programs, it’s possible that South Korea and Japan, threatened by a belligerent North Korea, will conclude that they need their own nuclear deterrent programs, rather than relying on U.S. extended nuclear deterrence commitments. Indeed, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/seventy-one-percent-south-koreans-now-support-return-nuclear-weapons-their-country-even&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;recent poll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in South Korea had over 70% of the people saying they needed their own nuclear weapons program, rather than relying on the U.S. nuclear umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons for security assurances that Russia ignored. Will the U.S. and NATO be there for Ukraine this time, or should Ukraine pursue its own nuclear deterrent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bombing of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts-assess-strikes-response-and-what-comes-next&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iranian nuclear sites&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz in June 2025 was in response to Iran’s continued enrichment of uranium at 60% or higher and Iran’s unwillingness to permit International Atomic Energy Agency monitors to inspect nondeclared suspect enrichment sites. Thus since 2003, when Iran said they ceased their nuclear weapons program, Iran has been a threshold nuclear weapons state, months away from being able to produce nuclear weapons if the U.S. and the European Union didn’t comply with Iran’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this reality, and if Iran produces or acquires nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt would rush to create their own nuclear weapons programs. The June 2025 U.S. bombing of these nuclear sites in Iran was an effort to ensure that Iran did not go nuclear, with the likelihood that these countries would also establish their own nuclear deterrent programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Kennedy’s expressed concerns about a nuclear arms race during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 was prophetic. Sixty-three later, there is real concern by a few non-nuclear-weapon states that they would need their own nuclear weapons to address the nuclear threat from North Korea and Iran, and the rhetoric from Mr. Putin and Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Security Council, who warned that Russia is prepared to use nuclear weapons if it faces defeat in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/dec/10/cuban-missile-crisis-lessons-forgotten-nuclear-arms-race-spreads/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <title>What Would Follow a Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation?</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/muslim-brotherhood-terrorist-designation-trump</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/amman-jordan-april-23-jordanian-police-close-the-entrance-of-a-muslim-brotherhood-headquarter-after-the-announcement-of-bann.jpg?id=62600396&amp;amp;width=1200&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;coordinates=33%2C0%2C34%2C0&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP DIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;On November 24, 2025, President Trump&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/designation-of-certain-muslim-brotherhood-chapters-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations-and-specially-designated-global-terrorists/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;launched&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a process to designate Muslim Brotherhood chapters in Lebanon, Egypt, and Jordan as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) and Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing fresh intelligence that these specific affiliates provided material support to Hamas after the October 7 attacks on Israel, the White House gave Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent a tight 30-day deadline to produce a formal report. The goal, administration sources say, is to sever the financial arteries — from charitable fronts to hawala networks — that have kept the Brotherhood’s regional machinery alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision comes at a moment when the Brotherhood’s once carefully cultivated image as the respectable face of political Islam lies in tatters. Days before Trump’s executive order, Texas Governor Greg Abbott made his state&lt;a href=&quot;https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-designates-muslim-brotherhood-cair-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;the first&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to label both the Muslim Brotherhood and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) as terrorist entities, vowing to target what he called “radical extremists.” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/florida-gov-ron-desantis-cair-muslim-brotherhood-foreign-terrorist-organizations/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;followed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the move by Texas with his own similar executive order. With federal momentum now behind him, the designations threatens to cascade across the region—and potentially beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hamas was founded as the Egyptian arm of the Muslim Brotherhood and has made this very clear in its Charter of 1987,” Hans-Jakob Schindler, Senior Director of the Counter Extremism Project, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “The political statement of Hamas of 2017 did not mention this link specifically, but it also did not state that Hamas would be independent. Hence, Hamas remains part of the Muslim Brotherhood network.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roots of a Transnational Shadow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To grasp the stakes, the story must begin in Ismailia, Egypt, in 1928, when schoolteacher Hassan al-Banna founded the Ikhwan al-Muslimin as a movement of Islamic revival and social reform. What started with Quranic lessons and charity work exploded into a mass organization of hundreds of thousands by the 1940s, complete with a secret paramilitary wing, the Special Apparatus, that carried out bombings and assassinations against British forces and Jewish targets. Egypt banned the group in 1948; al-Banna was assassinated shortly afterward, almost certainly by state security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy-handed crackdowns, periods of accommodation, and notable ideological shifts have defined the Brotherhood’s trajectory since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officially, the Brotherhood renounced violence in the 1970s, and it built an unrivaled network of mosques, clinics, schools, and labor unions. The 2011 Arab Spring briefly catapulted it to power: Mohamed Morsi became Egypt’s first elected president in 2012. Fourteen months later, mass protests and a military coup ended the experiment. Egypt declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization in 2013, killed more than 1,000 supporters in a single day at Rabaa Square, and imprisoned tens of thousands more. Exiled, splintered, and radicalized,&lt;a href=&quot;https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/mappingmilitants/profiles/muslim-brotherhood&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;remnants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; went underground or looked to Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernando Caravajal, executive director at The American Center for South Yemen Studies and an expert in Sudanese affairs, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that the Brotherhood’s ideological flexibility allows it to reemerge in power vacuums, but cautions that the potential United States terrorist designation likely stems from outside interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Notice the timing: these statements came a week after the meeting with Saudi,” he said. “It wasn’t announced during the meeting, so we can’t say Saudis are openly pushing it, but they clearly have a hand behind it because of the timing, because of the content. It mentions Jordan and Lebanon — those are Saudi priorities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riyadh’s priorities center on containing Islamist movements and curbing Iranian influence in the Levant, making Jordan and Lebanon key arenas for Riyadh’s regional security strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the region, local chapters adapted in different ways. Jordan’s Islamic Action Front (IAF)&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/thousands-jordanians-rally-amman-support-hamas-2023-10-20/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;became&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the kingdom’s most organized opposition, running hospitals and schools and holding parliamentary seats. Lebanon’s looser network operates in Palestinian camps alongside Hezbollah. Both insist they are peaceful and gradualist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to understand that the relationship between the Muslim Brotherhood and violence is a tactical one,” Schindler said. “It can change at any point if the network feels that violence would be useful for its position and influence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past American attempts to&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/muslim-brotherhood-trump-terrorist-organization-designation-threat-rubio-11102260&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;designate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the entire Brotherhood collapsed amid pushback from Qatar, Turkey, and some European allies. This time, the White House has chosen a surgical strike. According to Schindler, the White House’s endeavor to focus on individual chapters is an optimal approach because it targets “chapters in countries that have themselves banned and/or designated the Muslim Brotherhood (Egypt, Jordan) and on Lebanon, where the distinction between Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas is hard to make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

In Lebanon, the most explicit public demonstration came when a Brotherhood-affiliated militia calling itself the al-Fajr Forces fired rockets into northern Israel days&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hamas&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;after&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Hamas’s massacre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hamas is the Muslim Brotherhood organization in Gaza and the West Bank. It calls itself such. However, it operates independently,” Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council and Former DHS Deputy Assistant Secretary for Counterterrorism Policy, Thomas Warrick, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Its revenues were derived from control of Gaza’s governance: taxes, donations from outside governments, and criminal activities from which it profited. Other MB chapters are small in budgets and manpower compared to Hamas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jordan, the IAF organized some of the largest pro-Hamas demonstrations in the Arab world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The clearest demonstrated ‘link’ between Hamas and the specified Muslim Brotherhood chapters is that a Brotherhood-affiliated group in Lebanon, al-Fajr Forces, launched rockets into Israel following the October 7 2023 Hamas terrorist attack,” Rose Kelanic, director of the Middle East Program at Defense Priorities, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, stressing that “the Muslim Brotherhood is not a terrorist threat to the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Egypt, underground networks — despite Sisi’s repression — funneled money and propaganda into Gaza. Yet Schindler specifically highlights Lebanon’s darker role in Hamas’s external operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;According to German court documents, the Hamas cell that was arrested in Germany and the Netherlands in December 2023, which had planned and prepared for terror attacks in Germany, was led by Hamas handlers in Lebanon,” he noted. “Given the close connection between Hamas and the wider Muslim Brotherhood network, it is therefore likely that such contacts also exist in Lebanon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real power of the designation, however, lies in America’s arsenal of financial warfare. Once listed, any bank worldwide that touches Brotherhood money in dollars risks losing access to the United States market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Disrupting the ability of large-scale extremist and terrorist networks, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, to have unhindered access to the global financial system is, of course, a very effective way to hinder their overall operations,” Schindler explained. “Hence, any country where this access is more restricted is, of course, a problem for such networks as it will increase their operational costs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; on YouTube?

While Schindler sees Washington’s possible move as reinforcement that will “aid in the efforts of the Jordanian government in countering Muslim Brotherhood structures in the country,” Kelanic warns of unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only scenario I worry about is if the U.S. insists on applying the FTO designation to the IAF, because that amounts to major meddling in Jordanian politics,” she noted. “The last thing the U.S. needs is another failed state in the Middle East.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey, experts point out, is perhaps the bigger headache. Schinder asserts that Turkey “is indeed an important network hub for Hamas,” in particular when it comes to the group’s financial systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Turkey is in a unique position to pressure Hamas to give up its weapons and power in Gaza and leave the Strip,” he continued. “Unfortunately, so far, the Turkish government does not seem to have done so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Warrick, “what Turkey will do in response to the U.S. designation is not yet clear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Supporting Muslim Brotherhood affiliates in the region is a core policy of the Turkish government, but President Erdoğan is mindful that his relationship with President Trump is strong and is valuable,” he explained. “The Turkish government is aware of the Trump administration’s hostile attitude towards the Muslim Brotherhood but is not likely to change its approach except in countries that the U.S. government has formally designated Brotherhood branches as Foreign Terrorist Organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior U.S. intelligence official, speaking to &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on background, described the administration’s delicate balancing act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The President comes out with a statement where he’s clearly trying not to offend the Qataris too much, but at the same time satisfying the UAE and the Saudis and the Egyptians,” the insider noted. “He’s riding the fence on this but skewing more to the anti-side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington is particularly wary of antagonizing Doha because Qatar remains a critical mediator with Islamist movements and an indispensable interlocutor in hostage, de-escalation, and regional crisis negotiations. The Qatar-based Brotherhood chapter formally disbanded in 1999, and Doha has repeatedly denied formal support for the Muslim Brotherhood, despite continued investigations&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.counterextremism.com/sites/default/files/country_pdf/QA-01082021.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;indicating&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the group’s ongoing financial backing and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hscentre.org/latest-articles/qatars-role-2023-2024-israel-hamas-war/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;praise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the likes of Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same insider predicted domestic ripple effects: “If we suddenly see a ton of states passing laws against the Brotherhood and CAIR, then we start to have some real domestic impacts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAIR has long faced allegations of historical ties to the Muslim Brotherhood because some of its early founders were&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/council-american-islamic-relations-cair&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;involved&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with U.S.-based organizations linked to Brotherhood-affiliated networks, and because it was named as an “unindicted co-conspirator” in the 2007 Holy Land Foundation case. Critics cite these associations as evidence of ideological or organizational overlap. However, no criminal charges were ever brought against CAIR, and no direct operational link to the Brotherhood has been proven. CAIR&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cair.com/dispelling-rumors-about-cair/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;denies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; any affiliation, and most of the evidence remains circumstantial, dated, and heavily disputed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also point out that Saudi Arabia and the UAE, both of which already list the Brotherhood as terrorists, are quietly celebrating. But not everyone agrees that an FTO designation is a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doing a blanket listing of ‘the Muslim Brotherhood’ is a huge risk for the U.S.,” Caravajal said. “It allows people to be arrested simply for going to the wrong mosque.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a movement that has survived bans, coups, and massacres for almost a century, this is only the latest test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problem with designating the Muslim Brotherhood is that it never was a unitary organization or even a franchise organization like Al-Qaeda or Da’esh,” Warrick added. “This is why the solution the Trump administration came up with is the correct one. By working with partners that have already outlawed or sanctioned the Muslim Brotherhood chapters in their countries, the U.S. government can work cooperatively with those countries. This approach also gives some clarity to people in those countries, which groups they need to avoid in order not to be sanctioned by OFAC.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In statistical terms, the coming year will offer a multi-modal distribution of possibilities: a plausible path of robust, AI-led growth sits in the middle, flanked by a productivity miracle on one side and a risk-laden, bond-market-led downside on the other. Investors and policymakers must prepare for all of these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Social media footage showed apartments ablaze, balconies obliterated and a deep crater smouldering in a parking lot. Three people were killed and 13 injured in the November 17 attack, [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anti-Semitism is a National Security Issue: It’s Time to Treat it Like One</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/antisemitism-national-security-priority</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT OPINION / PERSPECTIVE&lt;/strong&gt; -- Less than three months ago, two people were killed in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/terrorism-manchester&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;terrorist attack&lt;/a&gt; on Jewish people in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgregp43kko&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;synagogue in Manchester, UK&lt;/a&gt;, on the most solemn day of the Jewish religious calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days ago, a large crowd of Jewish people in Sydney, Australia, celebrated Hanukkah on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/12/15/bondi-beach-terror-attack-isis-philippines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bondi Beach&lt;/a&gt;. Two Islamic terrorists, father and son, fired at them from a nearby bridge. Sixteen innocent Jewish people were murdered, including a Holocaust survivor and a ten-year-old child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point of a terrorist attack is that even a relatively contained engagement spreads widespread fear. This is particularly the case with the Jewish community. The background for Jews is centuries of persecution culminating in the indescribable horror of the Holocaust. Even since then Jews for many years have lived in fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was friendly with an Israeli diplomat in Turkey thirty years ago. He could not travel in his own car, hopping around Istanbul instead by taxi (dangerous enough), and no one knew where he lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synagogues and Jewish schools in the UK have the sort of security I was used to in Kabul. There is even a charity trust, CST, dedicated purely to the security of Jewish people here. When a terrorist incident happens, most Jews ask themselves “Are we safe here?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, terrorism is working well against Jewish people and western governments need to show that they are serious about opposing terrorism. You can’t have a democracy when terrorism against one community is tolerated. Not least, because assuredly if we give up on the security of Jewish people others will be next. That is why anti-semitism must be seen as a national security imperative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the UK united against Islamic terrorism in the aftermath of the murder of 52 Londoners in 2005, we realised that it was not enough simply to pursue possible terrorists and to be prepared for possible attacks. We realised that we needed to understand and combat the hatred that drove these attacks and to stop it infecting vulnerable people who might be tempted by the Al-Qaeda message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What national security news are you missing today?

That was the message of British prime minister Keir Starmer. That is fine but the solution for Jewish people, as the terrorists know, is not about even more security systems around their synagogues and schools, about armoured cars transporting schoolkids around north London or about how safe it is to be publicly identifiable as Jewish. “Safety concerns” have been used to ban an Israeli football team from playing in Birmingham, and non-political Jewish entertainers from appearing in Edinburgh. Jews are likely to conclude that this is no life, and there must be safer places to live: and you have lost your battle against terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only solution to defeat this terror is declaring war on anti-semitism. Lots of people will tell me how difficult this would be. How do you distinguish “legitimate” criticism of Israel from criticism that uses conscious or unconscious anti-semitism? Couldn’t a state-backed campaign against anti-semitism have the opposite effect to the desired one, leading to even more isolation and hatred of the Jewish community?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are serious risks: no one is saying this is easy. But the status quo is no longer acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more mass casualty attack – let's say in some European or American city on Passover, 2026 – and the Jewish community is going to be packing its bags. And you have lost your battle against terrorism. Anti-semitism is a national security priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, Chileans were tempted by the promise of a progressive “refoundation” of the country under Gabriel Boric, a former student leader, and elected him president. Now they have swung in the opposite direction, electing the far-right José Antonio Kast –&amp;nbsp;and are likely to be equally disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;“Our [the Joint Chiefs of Staff] job is to present and my job with the Joint Chiefs and others is to present the range of [military] options that this President or any President should consider with all of the secondary and tertiary considerations that go into those options, so that a President can make whatever decision he wants to make -- and then we deliver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine early in a 30-minute “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63FtvUJi_6I&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fireside chat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” with &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Morgan Brennan before an audience at the Reagan National Defense Forum on December 6, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Simi Valley, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to analyze Caine’s remarks, because they received almost no public coverage, and as Joint Chiefs Chairman, his stated views are worth recording – as were his predecessors’ during the first Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caine, who is extremely cautious in his public remarks, was originally asked by &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Brennan early in the chat, “How are you advising the President on Venezuela?” His first answer was, “Carefully,” which drew a laugh, but then he went on with the serious answer above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I picked that opening quote because most senior military officers would have answered just that they gave options, but in my experience few would have added the part about “all of the secondary and tertiary considerations that go into those options.” In short, I believe what Caine said in giving military options to President Trump, was that he gave both the upsides and downsides of what could happen with each option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In giving the above answer, Caine went on to say, “I wouldn't want to share any particular advice or options that we're giving, but we present a lot of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again I would point out that Caine carefully noted he would not spell out any “advice or option” he has given Trump, but the fact that so far the President has not yet followed through on his threat to attack ground targets in Venezuela may be because of the “secondary or tertiary considerations” Caine said would be the outcome associated with undertaking such overt actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public reactions to the 25 narco-boat attacks with their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/15/politics/us-military-strikes-three-boats-pacific&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;95 associated deaths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been bad enough. But they also raise questions about where Caine stood on that issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Brennan started the conversation with Caine asking his views about “these Caribbean strikes and the reporting around them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caine diverted from the question saying he was struck by the “sort of loss of confidence in the American military by the American people and that's deeply concerning to me.” He then said he wanted to add one detail to what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had earlier told the Reagan Forum about the boat strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That detail, Caine said, was that it was his idea along with Adm. Frank (Mitch) Bradley, the operational commander who ordered the so-called second strike on September 2, “to go up and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;share the information that we could share with the Congress.” The two gave classified briefings to leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, as well as military appropriators, on December 4, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/us/politics/drug-boat-strikes-sept-2-video-congress.html#:~:text=Lawmakers%20were%20expected%20to%20press,Legal%20experts%20have%20questioned%20that.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caine told the Reagan Forum they had done it “so that we could continue to sustain and scale that trust that we must earn every day from the American people through the Congress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 30-minute conversation, Caine avoided talking about Trump administration policy, just two days after Trump’s 2025 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Security Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;NSS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) had been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, when &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Brennan asked, “How do you see the alliance with Europe evolving?” – a controversial subject in the Trump &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;NSS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Caine responded, “We don't do policy in the Joint Force. We execute those policies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caine did recognize the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;NSS’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; new policy emphasis on the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Protecting the homeland is not just a term that we say anymore. It's a real thing and homeland security is national security,” Caine said. “I won't get into the operational matters, but there's plenty of visible examples…on where we are going to protect our neighborhood and do that pursuant to the things that we're able to do to make sure America is a safe and secure country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caine then added, “We have not, if you look back over the arc of our deployment history over the last few years, we haven't had a lot of American combat power in our own neighborhood. I suspect that's probably going to change. We'll see what we're ordered to do and of course we follow that guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Caine did focus on traditional threats saying, “From a military perspective, military alone, our relationships are good in Europe, and I'll let my bosses talk about the policy there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What national security news are you missing today?

They are, I think, going to own European security both through NATO and bilaterally and individually. The military leaders that I talked to are encouraged by the defense spending that's happening inside their countries. I would say, and have said to them, the same narrative around their defense and national industrial bases as we try to scale European defense so Europe can own Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caine added, “The SACEUR [Supreme Allied Commander Europe] over there, [U.S.] General [Alexus G.] Grynkewich, is carrying the same message through his EUCOM [U.S. European Command] hat. But that said, allies and partners remain a key part as laid out in the national security strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to the fighting in Europe, Caine told the Reagan Forum, “I want to be pretty cautious about commenting on Ukraine because of the ongoing negotiations. And I'm mindful that anything that I say could get spun one way or the other. I think, for me, I believe that we always want to be striving for peace and what's happened in Europe there is a tragedy out on the Ukrainian front lines. So I'm going to be pretty cautious given the meetings that are going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did say, “What the Ukraine industrial base has done to create tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-winter-coming&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;drones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is extraordinary. Those are the kinds of entrepreneurial lessons that we want to take from that fight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caine also talked of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/learning-from-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;military lesson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's another case study in the importance of the ability to put air power over a battlefield,” he said. “And when you look at the fixed and frozen lines that we've seen out in Ukraine, it's an opportunity for us to learn about the importance of protecting the force on the ground. And having been one of those guys on the ground earlier in my life, I value greatly the ability to have an air force or some kind of capability that can come in there and put an adversary in a particular place of pain. We haven't seen that out there in Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caine said, “One of the lessons out of Ukraine is going to be mass. And there's a lot of exchanges going on. And when I think about war fighting in the future, I see a lot of exchanges, both in the kinetic and non-kinetic space, that is probably unprecedented. So we're going to need a high-low mix that we've not seen before…but we are also going to need significantly more attritable [loseable] things that can create multiple simultaneous dilemmas for the commanders on another side of a fight than for us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today.

I know that from the U.S. perspective we've got an economic relationship now that is looking positive and trending fine. We see China still creating a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/china-navy-fujian-sichuan&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;combat capability and capacity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at scale, and as the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Security Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; says, we owe it to the nation to deliver a free Indo-Pacific and a free and safe and prosperous Indo-Pacific. So when I think about actions in the Pacific, mindful of the President's guidance, that's how we think about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the Middle East, Caine called it still “critical,” and said, “It's still I think undecided. I carefully watch through the CENTCOM (U.S. Central Command) commander what's happening in Gaza. I remain as always concerned about what Iran's intentions are down there. These are conflicts that have been going on for a long, long, time. I'm hopeful for peace but need to be prepared for any number of eventualities there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for here at home, Caine told the Reagan Forum, “What the American system, as it's been running for a long time now, is really good at is buying &lt;strong&gt;behind&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;the technology development curve &lt;/strong&gt;[emphasis added].&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;And what we need to do is get in front of the technology development curve. And that's going to require the best of the military, the best of the Congress, the best of the private sector, and the best of not just the defense industrial base, but the national industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caine explained, “Back in my life, I ran a small mom and pop machine shop in Denton, Texas, that made parts for America's aerospace and defense industry. And I'll tell you that everybody needs to up their game here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went on, “We have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/defense-acquisition-pentagon-steve-blank&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;change the culture&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; inside the [Defense] Department. We have to change the culture inside companies. And I've been in both. So I can see both of these things. We have to create and sustain and maintain competitive forces out there in the market where we are driving innovation in our corporate structures and systems that are going to give better combat capability to the Joint Force.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Caine said, “The military and the government need to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/defense-acquisition-pentagon-steve-blank&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;better buyers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and we have to write better contracts. I am still on step one of my 12-step recovery process from selling to the government when I was a part-timer in the military. I think we have to find a way to share risk between us and the private sector.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caine was an unusual choice by President Trump, who had first met Caine back in December 2018 in Iraq. The President claimed during a 2019 political speech he had met an Army officer, “Razin Caine,” who had worn a MAGA hat, said he’d “kill for Trump,” and claimed in Iraq he could defeat the ISIS terrorist group in Syria “in less than four weeks,” three Trump statements Caine later denied in interviews and during his 2025 Senate confirmation hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first wrote about Caine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/getting-to-know-the-next-chairman-of-the-joint-chiefs-of-staff&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;last March&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I was drawn to the facts that beginning August 2005 he served a year as a White House Fellow at the Agriculture Department and later, from October 2006 to January 2008, was Policy Director for Counterterrorism and Strategy for President George W. Bush’s White House Homeland Security Council. Caine’s last military post before resigning from the Air Force in 2024 was three years as Associate Director for Military Affairs at the CIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, at the Reagan Forum, Caine confessed, “I actually served at the Agency [CIA] twice. One is in my bio, one is not in my bio.” What’s that all about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caine clearly is a person the public needs to follow more closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>Winter is Coming to Ukraine as it Faces a New Kind of War and Uncertainty About a Key Ally</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-winter-coming</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/unspecified-location-ukraine-february-2024-a-ukrainian-drone-operator-pilots-an-attack-drone-during-a-test-flight.png?id=62502034&amp;amp;width=1200&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;coordinates=4%2C0%2C4%2C0&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT INTERVIEW — &lt;/strong&gt;Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky was in Berlin on Monday for an intense round of diplomacy with top U.S. and European officials, part of a fast-moving push to find a workable plan to end the war. His meetings follow an unusually long session on Sunday with President Donald Trump’s envoys, Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, who claimed significant progress in their discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a stream of European leaders - including Finland’s president, Britain’s prime minister, France’s president, and NATO’s secretary general are joining the talks. Russia was not invited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major sticking point among Western partners remains what concessions Ukraine might be asked to make. Washington has floated the idea of Kyiv giving up some territory Russia has not yet taken, a suggestion Ukraine rejects and most European leaders fear would reward Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelensky has signaled a willingness for Ukraine to pause its bid to join NATO if the U.S. provides firm security guarantees against future Russian attacks. European leaders are generally supportive of a deal that allows Ukraine to keep the territory it currently controls while securing long-term protection from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mood in Ukraine, meanwhile, is bleak. Former Senior CIA Executives Ralph Goff and Glenn Corn, both of whom are also Cipher Brief Experts, just returned from a 5-day trip in the country. We caught up with them in Krakow, Poland for some on the ground insights about both the mood and maneuvering inside Ukraine, as President Zelensky navigates a harrowing political environment. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE INTERVIEW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Having traveled to Ukraine with you both in the past, I am imagining that this latest trip must have felt like some of the most difficult days that Ukraine has faced in terms of how this war may come to a conclusion. What is the mood like there? What are people talking about? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corn: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The mood in Ukraine is not great. The Ukrainians are very concerned about a number of issues. One, they feel a lot of pressure from the U.S. to make a deal, which many Ukrainians are confused about. They’re trying to understand what's going on. And of course, they're not pleased with their own internal political situation. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euronews.com/2025/11/15/operation-midas-all-you-need-to-know-about-anti-corruption-investigation-in-ukraine&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Operation Midas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; corruption scandal was a blow, so there's a lot swirling around and it's clearly impacting the people that we spoke with. They're trying to keep a brave face, given what they're facing. They’ve been at war since 2014, and since February 2022, they've been in a horrific war, a full scale war, and they're just trying to keep their nose above water right now. And as one Ukrainian officer told me, we just have to get through the winter and survive these dark times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goff: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;There's also disappointment amongst our Ukrainian allies with the United States. Not all of it is unexpected, but at the same time they've got this war to fight, so there's a very business-like attitude like, ‘&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, we're still going to fight this thing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;’. And what's interesting is that they're not asking for anything new. They’ve made the same requests over and over. They need air defense weapons. There was a night when the Russians launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://understandingwar.org/research/russia-ukraine/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-december-14-2025/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;84 missiles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at Ukrainian territory and more than 500 drones in one night. We heard air raid sirens every night that we were there. The attacks are spread out across the country. It's clearly a campaign of terror by the Russian side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at the same time, the nature of the front - the battle - has changed completely from what it was just six months to a year ago. This is not the same war that was fought in 2022 or 2023 or 2024. This is a new war, and so the Ukrainians are asking for air defense weapons. They're asking for money. We can talk later about the idea of getting reparations money from the seized Russian assets, which they need. But at no point have they said they need troops. At no point have they asked for NATO’S &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nato.int/en/what-we-do/introduction-to-nato/collective-defence-and-article-5&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Article Five&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to be invoked. They still want to fight this thing on their own, but they need help from the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: The battlefront has changed so much just in the past few months. Could you describe what it's like now?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corn: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Every Ukrainian we spoke with, whether it was civilians, military people in the defense industry, they all said that this war is being fought by drones, by FPVs [first-person drones] and some artillery. Intelligence is critical, electronic warfare is critical. But the troops on the ground and the concept of infantry has changed completely. The Ukrainians continue to innovate very quickly, but as they've warned for the last year, the Russians are also innovating very quickly and they're scaling that innovation in a way that the Ukrainians can’t because of a lack of resources and maybe a lack of depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goff: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;That's correct. It is no longer an infantry man's war. The front is changed considerably. For 20 kilometers on either side of the front line, it’s almost a no-go lethal zone for humans. It's all electronic warfare. All drones and counter drones. I spent a day near the Zaporizhzhia front and even 40 kilometers back from the front lines, you're seeing drone netting set up everywhere and military vehicles using camouflage and taking extra precautions. So it’s completely different from when we visited there just a few months ago. But the losses continue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, in a single day recently, the Russians lost close to 1,300 soldiers. In one day. So Putin is still using pure raw manpower to his advantage, whereas Ukrainians have a manpower shortage. In one month, they recruited over 30,000 fighters, but out of that number, they're lucky if they can produce even a small percent of that. I'm not going to say the number because it's classified, but they're very lucky if they can get a decent number out of that. So it's tough for Ukrainians and they have to conserve their troops. They have to fight in a combat style that preserves human lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: In another way that we know the battlefield has changed, soldiers are now verifying kills or takedowns of targets, whether they're other drones, whether they're tanks on the ground, and they're using points earned from those drone missions to purchase equipment that is then delivered to them on the front. What can you tell us about the other ways in which the battlefield is evolving?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corn: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Battlefield integration has got to be seamless. The Ukrainians are working on that. We've spoken to a couple of people that are directly involved with that, and they're doing an incredible job. And one thing I was struck by during our last two or three visits is that now, more than ever, almost everyone we spoke with in a leadership position has no prior military experience. They're coming from private industry. Bankers, investment bankers. One guy we spoke with was running a tour agency overseas when he came back to fight. Now it’s computer programmers, IT folks, and they're all in the fight now. I spoke with one guy who was in a very senior government position before the war, and he told that he was 47-years-old before he put on a uniform, and he is leading a lot of the innovation stuff, and it's really impressive to see. We heard last time we were in Ukraine in September that the United States needs to pay attention to this and figure out how to integrate civilians into the military structure very quickly like Ukrainians have had to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

This is all about integrating all the information that comes from your airborne sensors, your ground sensors, your human observation, pulling intelligence into that. Tracking the emitters on the Russian side and then putting that all into a combat picture, particularly for the Ukrainians because they're fighting with reduced resources. So like I said, every human life is precious, but every weapon, every shot is also precious. In the old days when an artillery piece could maybe fire a hundred rounds in a day, now because they have to be so careful about being spotted when they're in action, they might fire 30 or 40 rounds. That means those 30 or 40 rounds really have to be on target. So it's all about the data. It's all about data management. And the Ukrainians, as Glenn said, are doing amazing work in that field. The biggest problem is that they're undercapitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: President Zelensky has been in Europe gathering support from the Europeans as he tries to navigate a complicated series of pressures to end this war. Is the feeling on the ground in Ukraine that that will be enough? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corn: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;I would say that the Ukrainians are in a bit of shock to see that the United States seems to be walking away - or their sense is that the United States is walking away. Let's hope that's not the case. But they're concerned that there is a rift between Europe and the United States. I think they appreciate what the Europeans are doing, but almost every discussion we’ve had centers on the fact that they need the United States here. They need the United States to provide some kind of long-term security guarantees. And by the way, the Ukrainians have been saying for over a year that they are ready to come to an agreement. They are ready to be realistic and compromise. It's the Russians that are not doing that. It's the Russians that continue to push maximalist demands and that continue to scuttle the peace process, not the Ukrainians. And the Ukrainians are very frustrated that they seem to be being made the bad guys in this struggle when their country was the one that was attacked. Their cities are being bombed, their children are being killed, their schools are being destroyed, their infrastructure is being destroyed, and they don't really understand what's going on right now. And I hope that we can get back to the position of the United States where we've traditionally been, which is the U.S. standing with people who are fighting for their freedom and their sovereignty against a much larger and more dangerous dictatorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goff: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;And of course, the recent high-level scandal involving the primary advisor to the President, Andriy Yermak, and his resignation has now been turned around by the Russians who are pointing a finger at this country, and it's resonating within certain circles in the United States. But that's laughable. This is coming from a country - Russia - which is a kleptocracy. Some have said that Ukraine is more corrupt than Russia. That's absurd. Russia is a kleptocracy. It's more like an organized criminal gang than anything else. And the idea that they would accuse Ukraine of being worse than them is crazy. But amongst Ukrainians, I think there's almost this kind of hope that this is some sort of a bad dream that will go away, that America will wake up at some point before it's too late and come riding to the rescue. But at the same time, the pragmatists here realize that maybe that's not going to happen, and it's time for Europe to step up. It's just like Putin gave the Ukrainians their national identity by invading them. The Trump administration is giving Europe the challenge to step up and take charge of their destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: With Andriy Yermak stepping down as President Zelensky’s chief advisor we know that there's another way of looking at this, which is that Ukraine has set up these independent institutes to investigate and root out corruption at every level and it looks like they’re determined to do that which is an indicator that Ukraine's own anti-corruption efforts are working to some degree, but that message seems to be completely lost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corn: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Yes. We've heard for a while now, that anyone who knows Ukraine, knows they have a problem with corruption. I've always said that it's baked into their system. The Russians baked this into the system going back hundreds of years, so you have to be realistic. They know it, and they talk about it, and they often talk about it openly. Having worked in Russia, it doesn't happen that way. People don't talk about it. They don't go to the streets and protest without being arrested and basically disappearing or being thrown out of windows. In Ukraine, there is a civil society element here. There is some control over the government, over the presidency, and there has been opposition and resistance to steps that were taken to try and squash the anti-corruption efforts. So, you have to give the Ukrainians credit because they're fighting a war, a horrendous war, and they are also trying to bring the country out of this ugly reality of corruption, which every country has and faces. But to deal with it, when you're in a full-scale war, it's something special. So in my opinion, we need to give 'em credit, and we also need to be clear-eyed and realistic and understand that without the United States' support, they're going to have a hell of a time making the changes that they need to make, and that many, many Ukrainians want to see made. They want their children to grow up in a country which has much less corruption and much more transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goff: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;This is a country where national polling has shown that people are more concerned about corruption than they are about the war at present. For the first time, polls have shown that corruption's a bigger problem than the war itself. That shows the awareness of the Ukrainian people. Corruption - we're not trying to downplay it - is a problem, clearly. But there are people who have exaggerated it to the point where if corruption were as bad as some would say it is, they would've lost this war three years ago, because that stuff has to get to the front. It's all going into the pockets of ministers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Has there been anything on this particular trip that surprised you or that you didn't expect?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corn: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Well, I mean for me personally, just I think the shock of the recent release of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Security Strategy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the sense that somehow Europe is a problem or Europe is the enemy. I don't know if that was the intent of that document, but that worries the Ukrainians, and of course it worries many of our European partners. For those people, I have to say, yeah, we have our differences with Europe, and as an American I've often felt that the Europeans should be doing a lot more, but the Europeans have also done a lot with us over the years, and for all the Europeans out there, for those I've worked with over the years, I am very appreciative of everything that you did to support the United States in many, many hard parts of the world where we served side by side together. So, Europeans are not the enemy, and by the way, we've never done that with the Russians, and I doubt we ever will. I doubt the Russians will stand side by side with us on the battlefield and support us the way that our European partners have done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goff: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;I think my biggest surprise here was the fact that the lights are still on. With all the bombings, like I said, we had air raids every night. Every few nights the pattern seems to be that the Russians husband their missiles and drones so that at least once or twice every five to seven days, they have a massive attack of 50, 60 missiles accompanied by 400, 500, 600 drones. And they're going after the energy infrastructure here. The lights are still on but with reduced power. There are some places that are down to a few hours a day, but you know what? They've still put up Christmas lights. They've still put up decorations. People are still trying to cling to some sense of normalcy for the season to get through this winter, and that just shows that these people are incredibly resilient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: What are you sensing will happen next based on who you've talked to and what you've seen since you've been on the ground in Ukraine?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corn: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I think the Russians are not going to make a peace agreement unless they get everything they want, and let's hope that we don't give them everything they want because they don't deserve it, they haven't earned it, and they're not in a position to accomplish it by the means that Putin keeps threatening to do it, which is military force. The Ukrainians have proven that they can hold the line. That's number one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number two, I hope that we come around to understanding that basically the right side here is the side of the Ukrainians. The Russians should be ashamed of themselves for what they're doing. They need to stop what they're doing, and we need to stand with the Ukrainians and teach Vladimir Putin a lesson as well as other dictators or potential autocrats like Putin and aggressors, that we're not going to stand on the sidelines, and we're not going to punish those people that try and defend themselves and support those people that aggress other people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have common values with the Ukrainians, which I was raised to believe in. I'm not speaking as a former intelligence professional. I'm speaking as an American, whose father served in the Army, whose brother served in the Army, and who dedicated his life to the United States of America. We did that because we believe in the values that the Ukrainians are fighting for right now, every day - in terrible conditions - and we shouldn't abandon them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goff: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;I think we're going to see some type of mobilization, an increased mobilization on the Russian side. Their losses are high while their territorial gains remain low and the Russian economy is faltering and Putin has not been able to browbeat the Ukrainians to give in and come to the table to seek just any deal. Ukrainians will come to the table. This is where I think the administration is making a mistake. The Ukrainians will come to the table if there is a more fair deal. The ideal arrangement will be where both sides are unhappy, but at this point, despite all the negative pressure on the Ukrainians, they're not going to just sign any deal that gets to the table, and that's going to put more pressure on Putin to continue the war. He's got to show some gains. So I think we're going to see some sort of mobilization on the Russian side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; on YouTube?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Indo-Pacific lacks many of the institutions and alliances that are now teetering elsewhere. But as instability proliferates worldwide, they are urgently needed, and the region's leaders should commit to realizing the late Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzō’s vision of an Indo-Pacific that is open, united, stable, and secure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The only way to deter him from pursuing &quot;reunification&quot; with the island is to make clear that the costs of doing so will be punishing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The instability caused by the Nazis' mass deportations and Kristallnacht in the autumn of 1938 was unpopular in Germany – much as ICE raids are unpopular in US cities. For the Nazis, the radical next steps were possible only under cover of war – which may be true for US President Donald Trump as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>China and America Must Get Serious About AI Risk</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/china-us-ai-risks-call-for-urgent-diplomacy-by-jake-sullivan-2025-12</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;China and America will continue to compete vigorously for the lead in AI. But as the world’s two – and only – AI superpowers, both countries urgently need to engage one another directly to address the growing list of dangers that the technology poses to markets, infrastructure, social stability, and humanity itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why China Can’t Win the AI-Led Industrial Revolution</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/why-china-cannot-win-ai-race-by-di-guo-and-chenggang-xu-2025-12</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;History has consistently shown that industrial revolutions require free institutions and robust demand to support ongoing entrepreneurship and the commercialization of new, productivity-enhancing products and services. With its system of totalitarian party-state rule, China checks none of these boxes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Crypto an Opportunity or a Threat?</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/crypto-from-bitcoin-to-stablecoins-all-ultimately-threat-to-social-financial-stability-by-jean-tirole-2025-12</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Innovation should enhance economic fundamentals, not erode them. With enthusiasm for crypto remaining strong, speculative unbacked tokens and lightly regulated stablecoins must be contained before they threaten financial stability and become part of the shadow banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump Is Canceling the Rule of Law – and US Democracy</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/trump-end-of-rule-of-law-means-end-of-american-democracy-by-aziz-huq-2025-12</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not only has the second Trump administration shown an utter contempt for the rule of law, but so too have its allies in Congress and on the Supreme Court. The bedrock principle that has long defined and sustained the American democratic project is being shredded before our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Latin America’s New Birth of Democracy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The populist wave that crashed over several Latin American countries not so long ago now may be retreating. Across the region, people are waking up to their rulers’ lies and misdeeds and rediscovering the liberal, republican values that defined earlier periods of their history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the United States and its allies finally led a push to end the Gaza war in 2025, it is not clear how regional stability will be restored, or what shape a new regional order will assume. For the foreseeable future, the Middle East will be bracing for a prolonged conflict as Israel pursues military supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gambling With the Dollar’s Future</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While there is no immediate candidate to supplant the US dollar, ballooning US deficits, the risk of higher US inflation, and the fragmentation of global trade have complicated the picture. In this environment, US policymakers' complacency about America's &quot;exorbitant privilege&quot; seems dangerously unjustified.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Year That Could Be</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/year-ahead-2026-by-lea-ypi-2025-12</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A decade after Brexit and Donald Trump's first election to the US presidency, states are increasingly isolated from one another, institutions are held hostage to the arbitrary will of individuals, and the rule of law seems irreversibly in decline. Yet even without cause for optimism, one can – and must – muster hope.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A New Age of Nuclear Proliferation?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not only are major nuclear-weapon states failing to pursue arms control and disarmament; they are openly doubling down on &quot;modernizing&quot; and expanding their arsenals to match their increasingly bellicose rhetoric. Fragile global structures that are supposed to prevent our self-annihilation are crumbling before our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump and the End of American Hegemony</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2025, Donald Trump's erratic, unlawful policies upended the postwar era of globalization and set in motion a process that will culminate in America's loss of global primacy. Not only are the sources of US economic strength being destroyed, but all other countries are de-risking from America as fast as they can.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the United States cutting aid, scrapping international agreements, and waging war on rules-based systems and arrangements that it built, questions about the future of the global order have gained new urgency. Though America may be replaceable in some areas, others may become a new Wild West.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is more than a little irony in the fact that Ukrainians are bleeding and dying for Western democracy and the European Union at a time when so many are losing faith in both. But they are –&amp;nbsp;and they have shown that they can win.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The West is facing its greatest challenge in decades. The postwar order that was shaped by the trauma of World War II and the Holocaust, and built on a foundation of political compromise, respect for other countries’ sovereignty, free markets, civil liberties, and minority protections, is now at risk of collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as Asian democracies had to adapt to a long period of economic and geopolitical uncertainty following the American withdrawal from Vietnam 50 years ago, now they must do so again. Donald Trump's return has forced the region to pursue self-reliance and new, mutually beneficial economic arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is all too easy for world leaders to turn away from conflicts where there is no simple solution, or crises where there is no quick fix. But in today's world, from the Middle East and Ukraine to Myanmar and Sudan, that would leave few conflicts and crises to address.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nationalists and populists may often speak the loudest in today's political discourse, but that does not make them representative. In fact, global polls still show a clear majority in support of international cooperation to address conflicts, poverty, climate change, and other shared challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence to high and unpredictable tariffs, Donald Trump has pursued a slew of misguided policies that threaten to fuel stagflation, trigger financial instability, and end US dollar dominance. Emerging-market and developing economies must take action to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Cipher Brief's Recommended Reads for the Holidays</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-cipher-brief-s-recommended-reads-for-the-holidays</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOOK REVIEWS &amp; RECOMMENDATIONS &lt;/strong&gt;-- Welcome to our annual holiday book review and recommendations list, where we highlight some of the terrific books that have been reviewed and featured in &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt; in recent months. Since our &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchi.mp/thecipherbrief/the-cipher-briefs-hot-summer-reads?e=1a4b6b19c6&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;summer newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, we've covered and reviewed more than 35 books – often sliced and diced by world-class subject matter experts. In this newsletter, we’ve singled out about a dozen that received our highest four out of four “trench coat” rating. As always, the books reviewed in &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt; represent an eclectic mix of topics ranging from the history of past wars to the prospects of future ones. We’ve included both fiction and non-fiction faves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FICTION FAVORITES:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tops on many folks’ list is &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/47p80Ee&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Persian: A Novel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by veteran CIA analyst David McCloskey. For this one, we turned once again to Joe Zacks, a veteran of four-plus decades of government service, to offer his take. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/iran-israel-espionage-the-persian&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Zacks writes&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;The Persian&lt;/em&gt; may be the finest of McCloskey’s four spy novels to date (high praise given how well the first three were received). For this one, Zacks calls McCloskey’s novel “a sophisticated and multidimensional depiction of human nature and the motivations that propel people to action. It brings the HUMINT discipline to life, vividly portraying how a sophisticated intelligence service identifies, targets, and ultimately recruits and handles an agent while plumbing the depths of the agent’s psyche and inner conflicts.” To learn even more about the book – and its author – Cipher Brief CEO &amp; Publisher Suzanne Kelly did a debrief with McCloskey in this fun-filled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/david-mccloskey-secrets-of-a-novelist&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Cover Stories podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To review veteran spy novelist Daniel Silva’s 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/4nxdkLi&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;An Inside Job&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, we turned to a couple of CIA veterans – Anne and Jay Gruner. The latest Silva book brings back skilled art restorer and former Mossad chief Gabriel Allon, in a fast-paced tale involving art theft, European crime and corruption – and a newly elected Pope. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/an-inside-job&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;The Gruners’ review&lt;/a&gt; declares that Silva has once again demonstrated that he is a master of his craft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Gabriel Allon, the hero of Silva’s novel, is a fictional former Mossad officer, a genuine Mossad alumni, Yariv Inbar, is also a prolific novelist. His latest book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/4fkPDCf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behind the Trigger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/behind-the-trigger&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;reviewed for us&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Ken Dekleva, a novelist in his own right and a former Regional Medical Officer/Psychiatrist for the State Department. With that background, Dekleva was quick to spot Inbar’s skill in describing the human, emotional, and psychological aspects of espionage. The book features two central female characters and a Middle East canvas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all of the novels that won plaudits on &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt; came from long-time authors. There was the thriller &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/44CMavc&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moldavian Gambit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by first-time novelist Brad Meslin about a man-portable nuclear device that goes missing at the time the Soviet Union was coming apart in the early 1990s and may have fallen into the hands of a terrorist -- and possibly smuggled into Paris. We asked James Lawler, a former CIA officer with deep experience in thwarting rogue state weapons proliferators and &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/41u93iT&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the author&lt;/a&gt; of several well-received novels himself &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/moldavian-gambit&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;to review it&lt;/a&gt;. Lawler gave Meslin high marks for technical accuracy and heart-stopping story telling. Meslin also joined us on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-moldavian-gambit&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;a Cover Stories podcast&lt;/a&gt; to discuss what inspired him to write the novel and his sources and methods for keeping readers on the edge of their seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE NON-FICTION BOOKS THAT ROCKED CIPHER BRIEF REVIEWERS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Latin American counternarcotics operations much in the news, a timely read is &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/45pXuKi&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;After Escobar: Taking Down the Notorious Cali Godfathers and the Biggest Drug Cartel in History&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reviewed by veteran government lawyer Terence Check. Written by former DEA agents Chris Feistl and Dave Mitchell with an assist from Jessica Balboni, the book tells the two-year saga in the mid-1990s of the investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of the leading “godfathers” of the Cali drug cartel (aka “Cocaine, Inc.”) one of the biggest multi-billion-dollar drug trafficking enterprises of all time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/fall-of-cali-cartel&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, Check writes that &lt;em&gt;After Escobar &lt;/em&gt; “is really a story about diplomacy, and the power it has as a force multiplier for our law enforcement and military….(showing) the reader the importance of the diplomatic cadre in helping to bring down the Cali Cartel by doing the hard work of negotiating with the Colombian government.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The criticality of diplomacy was at the forefront of another book this fall. &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/4mBFyU1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Great Power Diplomacy: The Skill of Statecraft from Attila the Hun to Kissinger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by A. Wess Mitchell. The book was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/great-power-diplomacy&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt; by retired &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/gary-grappo&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;U.S. Ambassador Gary Grappo&lt;/a&gt;. In his review Grappo describes the book as “part history lesson and part instruction manual for national leaders and diplomats, reprising the tactics, strategies, methods and actions of previous major state leaders and diplomats who found themselves confronting similar great power contests.” Grappo lauds the book for being a: “resounding reaffirmation of the value and importance of diplomacy as an indispensable component of national power not just in the past but even more so today. The skills of its practitioners may need rejuvenating. But there is no denying that diplomacy ultimately holds solutions to the problems of today.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several books we will highlight here offer fresh looks at past history. Let’s start with one from Yale University Press: &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/4ll7U3H&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;No More Napoleons: How Britain Managed Europe from Waterloo to World War One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt; The book was written by Andrew Lambert and one of our most prolific reviewers, Jean-Thomas Nicole, a Policy Advisor with Public Safety Canada, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/no-more-napoleons&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; it. Nicole praised the book for its reminder of “the enduring utility of maritime power, the virtues of restraint, and the necessity of maintaining influence without overreach.” Nicole notes that these themes resonate strongly with today’s global challenges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World War II and the events that led up to and followed it are often good fodder for books. Among those that stood out for us this year was&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/4eBLFoq&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Spy and the Devil”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Cipher Brief expert &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/tim-willasey-wilsey&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Tim Willasey-Wilsey&lt;/a&gt;. Journalist and author Michael Smith &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-mi6-spy-who-met-hitler&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;reviewed it for us&lt;/a&gt; and called it “one of the greatest untold stories of the Second World War intelligence.” It is the story of a Lithuanian-born ‘Baltic-German’ who ended up working for British intelligence and managed to penetrate the highest Nazi circles prior to the war including having several meetings with Adolf Hitler himself. Willasey-Wilsey also joined us on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-spy-and-the-devil&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Cipher Brief Cover Stories podcast&lt;/a&gt; to talk about this remarkable story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In October, we published a review of &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/48oQi4i&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Traitor’s Circle: The True Story of a Secret Resistance Network in Nazi Germany – and the Spy Who Betrayed Them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Jonathan Freedland. Australian writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/traitor-circle&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Susan Gorgioski&lt;/a&gt; reviewed it and told us the book reads like a detective novel but tells the real story of a “little-known group of opponents to the Nazi regime in Germany who were willing to sacrifice careers, social position, money, and ultimately for some, their lives.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3ItwS3c&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rain of Ruin: Tokyo, Hiroshima and the Surrender of Japan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Richard Overy and reviewed by former senior CIA clandestine service officer (and Cipher Brief expert) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/sonya-seunghye-lim&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Sonya Seunghye Lim&lt;/a&gt;. In her review, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/rain-of-ruin&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Lim praises&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Rain of Ruin&lt;/em&gt; for being a “thought-provoking and disturbing book” and its explanation for “why armed conflicts will continue to plague the world: dehumanizing the enemy, depersonalizing killings by making attacks as remote as possible, and glamorizing combat serve to palliate our collective conscience and to justify the persistence of jingoism.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not all the good stuff came from ancient history. CNN anchor Jake Tapper published a book in October called &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/469xy66&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Race Against Terror: Chasing an Al Qaeda Killer at the Dawn of the Forever War.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt; So, we turned to someone with deep expertise – Joe Zacks who was just wrapping up a 42-year career - half in the Army and half as a CIA officer - and whose final post was Deputy Assistant Director of the CIA for Counterterrorism, to review it for us. Perfect credentials to evaluate Tapper’s book which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/race-against-terror&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Zacks&lt;/a&gt; describes as “ a mix of detective story and legal drama” about a six-year odyssey of tenacious federal prosecutors trying to bring an al Qaeda terrorist to justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of our best received books were about future intelligence challenges. For example, there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/46OOgZX&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fourth Intelligence Revolution: The Future of Espionage and the Battle to Save America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Anthony Vinci. We tapped Cipher Brief expert and principal with the Cyber Initiatives Group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/glenn-gerstell&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Glenn Gerstell&lt;/a&gt; to review that one for us. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/glenn-gerstell&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, Gerstell describes the book as examining “the confluence of increasingly complex geopolitical challenges and of global technological advances” and tells us that the conclusion is that “America’s spy agencies must not merely adapt but also dominate this dynamic if we are to blunt (if not defeat) our adversaries.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no matter how good the technology is going forward, you’re gonna need people to make it all work right – and they need to be people who can get a security clearance. So, what do you need to know in order to try and do that? Fortunately, there’s a book for that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3LYrTJw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust Me: A Guide to Secrets: Who Gets Them and Why We Have Such a Mixed Track Record with Them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Lindy Kyzer. We trusted retired CIA Deputy Director for Analysis (and current Cipher Brief Expert) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/linda-weissgold&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Linda Weissgold&lt;/a&gt; to review it. Weissgold is also a professor at Texas A&amp;amp;M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service in Washington, DC and says she now recommends the book to her students who want to understand the opaque yet crucial process of getting a security clearance. The book offers practical and philosophical advice that seeks to demystify the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While a little harder to give as holiday gifts, there are some podcasts interviews we highly recommend as well, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A discussion with Marine and CIA ground branch veteran – and award-winning writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/talking-skwerl-and-cheese-with-author-elliot-ackerman&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Elliot Ackerman&lt;/a&gt; discussing his latest novel &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/4oW7frc&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sheepdogs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A deep dive into North Korean matters &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-north-korean-threat-intelligence-and-diplomacy&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;with Ambassador Joe DeTrani&lt;/a&gt; on his memoir &lt;em&gt;The North Korean Threat: Intelligence and Diplomacy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A discussion with journalist and Marine veteran &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/rekindling-memories-of-the-fuji-fire&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Chas Henry&lt;/a&gt; about a devastating Pacific cyclone that triggered a horrendous fire at Marine Corps Base in Japan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And even a book by a publishing expert, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-person-who-wrote-the-book-on-writing-books&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Jane Friedman&lt;/a&gt;, who offers essential advice on how YOU can write your own book.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rather than improving global security, surging military expenditure threatens to deepen geopolitical instability, destroy ecosystems, fuel arms races, raise conflict risks, and crowd out public investment in other priorities, not least development aid.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some right-wing political leaders view Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown as a model to emulate. But a closer look at the numbers confirms that, while denouncing foreigners can be politically fruitful, attempting to get rid of them is both economically costly and demonstrably futile.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recent explosion of coups and coup plots in West Africa, most recently in Benin, suggests that the region's performative approach to Western-style democracy is running out of steam.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has finally added Russia to its list of “high-risk” third countries with strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls.

London was already fighting for its very survival, standing alone after the fall of France; Washington was not yet fighting at all. Public opinion tilted toward isolationism, and President Roosevelt had to proceed slowly to avoid losing the support of both Congress and the U.S. public. Yet a year later, the Atlantic Charter was signed with Churchill, publicly declaring a shared stand against tyranny and an alliance that would stand for the rest of the century. But behind the scenes, the two leaders negotiated a deeper exchange: American weapons for British technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/lend-lease-act&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lend-Lease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the United States sent destroyers and vital equipment to keep Britain in the fight against Nazi aggression. Less understood was what the U.S. quietly received in return: cutting-edge capabilities that would shape its own success once it entered the war. That historical moment holds lessons for today, with America again questioning its commitments abroad, and for the value of learning from a Ukrainian ally engaged in a war we are not fighting ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Britain’s most consequential contributions in 1940 was the technology behind “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205196922&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chain Home&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” an early, revolutionary radar network. A constellation of radio stations sent out beams whose returns revealed the direction, altitude, and approximate numbers of incoming Luftwaffe aircraft during the Battle of Britain. Integrated with human observers and command-and-control stations, the system allowed RAF leaders to deploy their limited squadrons with precision, conserving fuel, protecting pilots, and preserving the nation’s survival. As Churchill famously said of the RAF, “never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That success was not only a triumph of courage but a triumph of rapid wartime innovation and operational learning. And it is exactly the kind of learning the United States must pursue now as Ukraine pioneers new modes of drone warfare against a technologically sophisticated adversary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/us-ukraine-drone-deal&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Drone warfare&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Ukraine today is the chain home radar of our time. Today in Ukraine, that country “owes so much to so few”: drone warrior heroes fighting not only for their country, but for all of Europe and democracy. The drone operators and their innovation are helping Ukraine to stay in the war against overwhelming Russian numbers. The U.S. and other NATO allies have provided large weapons systems like HIMARS, ATACMS, Abrams tanks, and F-16s. All of these systems at one time were supposedly ruled out for Ukraine, only to be provided later. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s own drone industry and innovations have helped it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-attack-on-russian-oil&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;turn the tide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of countless battles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been frustration in the U.S., however, with the support. Many are asking: for all the weapons and funding we have provided to Ukraine, what are we getting back? Defending freedom and fighting Russian aggression for Europe and our allies should be enough for our arsenal of democracy. But it’s a fair question. It is understandable after 20 years of war that the American people want to know what else we are getting if the U.S. is to be so heavily engaged financially and militarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

The Army War College has led a multi-year effort to help in a project called “Call to Action: Lessons for the Future Force”. Others in various military training and testing commands across all our services, and our allies, are doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many more lessons to be learned, and not enough resources are being put into the fight. For years, the U.S. embassy and government were limiting the number of official Americans and contractors allowed into the war zone to work with and learn from the Ukrainians. That should end for good, and we should be flooding our ally with experts ready to help, but also to learn. One of the areas we should be drawing a lot more lessons from is drone warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russian military and its intelligence services have learned a lot about drone warfare in Ukraine. They have stood up an entire new service of their troops devoted to drone warfare, as well as a drone center called Rubikon, which is changing the battlefield. The Russians are also using drones in gray warfare &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/putin-s-drone-hit-a-nato-nerve-in-poland-opening-an-opportunity-for-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;against NATO countries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to probe their borders, weaknesses at airports, and other facilities across the continent in what has grown in recent months into a wave of drone incursions. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-sabotage-shadow-war&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;hybrid warfare&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; practiced by a country and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russias-intelligence-services-after-the-war-will-they-be-held-accountable-for-their-failures&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;intelligence services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that have a long history of doing so: testing reactions, looking for weak points, antagonizing the alliance to find soft spots, or partners willing to acquiesce to Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In turn, we in the NATO alliance and in the U.S. are slow to adapt. The United States needs to deploy more personnel, more resources, more engineers, and experts into Ukraine to learn all the desperately valuable lessons about the world’s first truly all-encompassing drone war. It is monumental both in scale and evolution. Just as the United States learned valuable lessons about radar, which saved countless American pilots and other lives throughout World War II, we need to learn these important lessons from the Ukrainians about drone warfare before we may find ourselves engaged in a conflict we are not prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three salient lessons for those who are studying the war and how it has evolved just in the past four years. These are areas the U.S. should focus more resources on. The first lesson that we need to study from the Ukrainians involves the electromagnetic space on the battlefield and electronic warfare (EW). American soldiers have never operated in a battle space so encumbered by all manner of electromagnetic jamming, as is taking place every day across the battlefields of Ukraine. Cyber operations, both enabling and disabling various systems, command and control, and what is called “PNT” or the precision navigational systems of all manner of weapons— all are being jammed and interfered with on an unprecedented scale in the EW space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second lesson we need to understand and learn from are the ingenious innovations and adaptations that the Ukrainians, in particular, have carried out with their drones. Ukraine stood up an entire industry to build millions of the very smallest type of drones designed to target an individual Russian soldier in a trench, to much larger mother drones to carry other drones, deliver supplies, and even carry out strategic strikes like those against Russian bombers at airfields, taking off from “conex” shipping containers. These are remarkable operations and feats that we can mine for lessons from our Ukrainian allies. We are well behind their innovation and acquisition curve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third and finally, the most important lesson we need to learn from the Ukrainians is how to fight a war where we might be out-manned and out-gunned. That is not something the American people could have imagined for nearly a century. But Russia’s aggression is stark and unprecedented. Add to it the prospect of a potential war with China over the Taiwan Strait looming, which the Chinese are preparing and training for, also at an unprecedented level. They and the North Koreans are sharing weapons’ components and helping Russia evade sanctions. And in the case of the latter, North Korean soldiers are dying for Russia on the battlefield. They are getting the know-how and learning the lessons from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today. Gain access to save your virtual seat now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are at a point where all of China’s conventional forces, with very few exceptions - on the land, sea, and air (save for nuclear forces)- outnumber the United States. China has a larger land army, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/china-navy-fujian-sichuan&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;larger navy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now by volume of surface vessels, and a Chinese Air Force that rivals our own and NATO’s airpower. Many will argue correctly that the Chinese do not have the experience of decades of combat, as our pilots do, nor the expertise of our sailors and soldiers on the ground. But as many famous generals have noted in history, “quantity has its own quality.” This is also a lesson from Ukraine, as overwhelming numbers of Russian troops are wearing down the front lines of Ukraine in the east. Overwhelming numbers of drones and artillery, as well as missile strikes combining in multi-vector attacks—all these are also making a significant impact on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would be wise to engage with and learn more from our Ukrainian partners, just like the United States did 85 years ago from our British allies, before we were forced into war. It forged a “special relationship” that has stood for a century. We can hope for the same with our Ukrainian brothers and sisters fighting now against aggression in no less of a challenge to all of democracy than the Nazis were to Europe. Putin and his Chinese allies are out for world domination; make no mistake, we have to learn the lessons to prepare to fight and support our allies fighting again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we, supporters of Ukraine, hope this war will end soon, we also need to prepare for the next war. As Churchill said then, we should: “gather strength for the morning. For the morning will come. Brightly will it shine on the brave and true; kindly upon all who suffer for the cause; gloriously upon the tombs of heroes. Thus will shine the dawn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dawn will come, but so will night again. We should learn from the Ukrainian heroes who have suffered through all the nights of this war, not doubt their commitment to freedom, nor our own obligation to support them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the US Government.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the global growth rate in 2026 is projected to be almost the same as it was in 2025, the headline figure belies deeper structural shifts in capital flows and comparative advantage. These shifts are the real story, because they are quietly reshaping how global savings and investment interact over the coming decade.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Russia is Waging a Sabotage Shadow War on Europe</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-sabotage-shadow-war</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/police-cars-are-seen-on-november-17-2025-close-to-the-railways-that-were-damaged-in-an-explosion-on-the-rail-line-in-mika-next.jpg?id=62303368&amp;amp;width=1200&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP DIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;In the darkness of night on November 15, a massive explosion ripped through a stretch of the Warsaw-Lublin railway line close to Mika, Poland, severing a critical logistics route used to ship military equipment and aid eastward from Warsaw toward the Ukrainian border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blast,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/eng/news/2025/11/18/7225157/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;caused&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by a C-4 explosive device, damaged the tracks and a passing freight train’s wagon floor, halting rail traffic and sending ripples of alarm through Poland, one of Ukraine’s staunchest allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polish authorities quickly confirmed sabotage,&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/475619da2228aee03bfe90e75565f229&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;charging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; three Ukrainian nationals — Oleksandr K., Yevhenii I., and Volodymyr B. — with executing the plot under Russian direction. The incident was not a lone act but part of a growing wave of covert operations targeting railways, ports, and pipelines across Europe, aimed at undermining support for Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivana Stradner, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, characterizes these actions to &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as Russia “waging a long, low-cost pressure campaign that targets not only the battlefield but everyday life across EU countries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polish prosecutors outlined the operation’s chilling precision. In September 2025, Volodymyr B., arrested on November 20 and charged on November 22, drove Yevhenii I. to the sabotage site for reconnaissance, enabling the selection of the explosive placement. Oleksandr K. and Yevhenii I., the primary perpetrators acting on behalf of Russian intelligence, planted the device and a metal clamp intended to derail a train, then&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/polish-pm-says-two-responsible-railway-blast-worked-russian-intelligence-2025-11-18/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;fled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Belarus, where Poland’s extradition requests remain pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately following the attack, Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski characterized it as “state terror.” Warsaw closed Russia’s last consulate in Gdansk, and thousands of soldiers were deployed nationwide to protect critical infrastructure. The Kremlin, nonetheless, rebuffed the accusations as “Russophobia” and vowed to retaliate by severing Polish diplomatic ties. This exchange of moves points, however, to a larger trend: the use of subtle, sophisticated attacks aimed at crippling Ukraine’s supply lines without triggering a full-blown escalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proxies in the Shadows: Recruiting the Unwitting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow’s strategy for sabotage is&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/may/04/these-people-are-disposable-how-russia-is-using-online-recruits-for-a-campaign-of-sabotage-in-europe&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;built&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on proxies, using local citizens and displaced people to carry out attacks and maintain Russia’s plausible deniability. The situation in Poland is particularly disturbing, where the involvement of Ukrainian nationals exposes an aggressive recruitment campaign aimed at vulnerable youth from their war-torn home country. Ukrainian security services have documented a sharp rise,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/5cb5ebf9-bfb3-4a50-bc2f-79540baf8f87&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;reporting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Russian operatives have entrapped over 170 minors in the last 18 months, often luring them through Telegram channels disguised as job boards or casual chats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recruitment base consists of migrants from Eastern Europe and Russian-speaking citizens of countries where the sabotage operations are carried out. They are often individuals with criminal histories or financial problems. What begins as innocuous tasks — snapping photos of buildings or mailing postcards — escalates to&lt;a href=&quot;https://fact-news.com.ua/en/law-enforcement-officers-documented-62-cases-of-sabotage-involving-teenagers/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;planting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bombs or torching vehicles, often with payments that seem too good to refuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head of Ukraine’s National Police Juvenile Prevention Department, Vasyl Bohdan,&lt;a href=&quot;https://fact-news.com.ua/en/law-enforcement-officers-documented-62-cases-of-sabotage-involving-teenagers/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;described&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ploy’s subtlety: “For the most part, the children don’t understand what is happening, or that it’s very serious.” Experts note that Russian operatives often begin by masquerading as sympathetic figures to build trust with their targets. Once the relationship is established, they leverage compromising material to secure compliance through blackmail. In one recent instance in Ivano-Frankivsk, two teenagers were&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/1055096.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;promised&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; $1700 each and thus embedded a device that detonated remotely, killing one and maiming the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Russia’s intelligence services use Ukrainians inside NATO states because it blurs the political story and creates deniability, especially since many recruits are young, economically vulnerable, and have no prior ideological profile,” Natalya Goldschmidt, CEO of Lightning Associates LLC, a strategic geopolitical consulting firm focusing on Russia, Eurasia, and Latin America, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Most of the initial interactions now happen through encrypted apps and seemingly low‑stakes’ tasks, such as taking photos of infrastructure, moving small packages, or counting vehicles, which makes these pipelines hard to spot before an operation moves from reconnaissance to action.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s countermeasures have gained traction, with police and NGOs flooding schools and camps with warnings, partnering with celebrities like boxer Oleksandr Usyk to drill home the dangers. Reports of attempted recruitments have surged to 74 this year, and successful cases have plummeted, as Bohdan noted: the number of successful child recruitment cases has decreased “exponentially over the past year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Goldschmidt, Moscow’s hybrid operations and cognitive warfare are most effective against a Europe already fragmented by domestic political crises, economic fatigue, and unresolved debates over migration and identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most worrying escalation over the next year or so is not one spectacular act, but a carefully timed cluster of incidents that together amount to a strategic shock: rail disruptions and warehouse fires at a critical moment for aid to Ukraine, damage to energy or data links in Northern Europe, and Russian drones killing or seriously injuring someone on NATO territory, all wrapped in enough ambiguity to delay a unified response,” she cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This proxy model extends well into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Romanian intelligence smashed a parallel operation by&lt;a href=&quot;https://balkaninsight.com/2025/10/21/romania-poland-thwart-alleged-russian-linked-sabotage-plot/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;arresting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; two Ukrainian citizens. The pair had smuggled bomb components — incendiary devices disguised in car parts and headphones — into Bucharest, targeting the Nova Post headquarters, a Ukrainian courier firm moving vital aid. In addition to thermite and barium nitrate, the packages included counter-surveillance measures, exhibiting classic Russian tradecraft. According to investigators, the duo is part of a wider network acting under Moscow’s direction, which has allegedly targeted Nova Post sites in Poland and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threat became clearer that same week when Poland&lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/polish-authorities-detain-8-suspected-sabotage-plot-tusk-126710455&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;detained&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; eight suspects tied to planned infrastructure attacks. Officials in Europe attribute these coordinated operations to Russian elite formations, notably GRU Unit 29155. General Andrei Averyanov leads the unit and is part of a dedicated sabotage hub under General Vladimir Alekseev, which marshals over 20,000 Spetsnaz operatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

From Germany to the Nordic states, prosecutors and security services have reported a pattern of suspected sabotage in fires and parcel-incendiary incidents that have scorched logistics hubs and defense manufacturing sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, GPS and navigation&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyx3ly54veo&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;jamming&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; across the Baltic and northeastern Europe has surged — European ministers and national regulators report daily interference that has disrupted flights and aviation operations, and they warn of substantial economic impacts. In September, mass drone overflights and cross-border incursions, including a large wave of drones into Poland and a 19-September violation of Estonian airspace by MiG-31s, prompted NATO consultations and temporary airport closures in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These disruptions, while seemingly tactical, tie directly into a broader strategic calculus aimed at testing NATO’s unity and response mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategic heart of the issue is NATO’s collective defense clause. Stradner also notes that, “Vladimir Putin has been candid about his desire to discredit NATO’s Article 5 in which members pledge to treat an attack against one ally as an attack against all.” She argues that because Putin, “Trained as a KGB operative, is well versed in so-called ‘active measures,’” his goal is to challenge the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Graef, Senior Policy Fellow at the European Leadership Network, however, contends to &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that “the actual impact of these sabotage acts on the flow of aid to Ukraine remains extremely limited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his view, the activities are primarily aimed “less at disrupting logistics than at influencing public opinion in Western societies by trying to convince voters that further support for Ukraine carries unacceptable risks.” He stresses that this strategy “rests on a misreading of Western threat perceptions,” as such actions tend to “reinforce the opposite conclusion: that Russia is a growing danger and that support for Ukraine, as well as investment in defense, must increase further.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Article 5 threshold remains deliberately high. Invoking it requires consensus within the North Atlantic Council. It is hard to imagine such agreement emerging in response to low-level sabotage, ambiguous incidents, or non-lethal disruptions,” Graef said. Therefore, Moscow does indeed appear to be “calibrating its operations to stay well below that line. Still, it is not achieving its intended political effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Barros, Russia Team &amp; Geospatial Intelligence Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War, concurs to &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that Russia is “boiling the frog and NATO member states have so far elected to not treat Russian acts of war against them as they truly are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Russia has already passed the threshold with its sabotage actions, manned aircraft airspace incursions, and missiles entering the airspace of Poland and Romania. Russia seeks to normalize this activity so that NATO de facto approves a new normal, in which case we don’t treat Russian acts of war seriously,” he noted. “The West has far too long allowed Russia to operate against us with relative impunity. The West must seize the strategic initiative from Russia and begin imposing dilemmas on Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even as these operations escalate, analysts say Russia is careful to keep them calibrated just below the line that would trigger NATO’s collective-defense clause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with Article 5, as experts observe, is that the ‘hybrid’ qualities of ambiguity and deniability – which, it is feared, Russia would manipulate to come close to the Article 5 threshold without reaching it – can paralyze the institutional and political mechanisms of collective defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Putin does this all the time. It’s the same pattern — gray-zone hybrid operations run out of the GRU,” former CIA station chief Daniel Hoffman, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Operating against enemies on foreign soil with impunity and facing no repercussions. They’re sending a message.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; on YouTube?

In response to September’s airspace breaches, EU defense ministers accelerated deployment of a “drone wall” along the eastern flank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To harden against airspace violations, Graef advises that measures must be tailored, noting that while airspace violations require increased internal coordination, harmonized rules of engagement, and improved information sharing, sabotage is primarily the responsibility of “police, counterintelligence services, and judicial authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He maintains that if Russia’s objective is to weaken European support, then “demonstrating political unity is in itself an important countermeasure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maksym Skrypchenko, nonresident scholar in the Russia Eurasia Program, points out that, from Kyiv’s purview, European governments’ measures to protect infrastructure are catastrophically insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Russia is several steps ahead, while Europe is acting reactively rather than proactively. Russian embassies remain operational, and Russian tourists continue to travel, which is being exploited not only for information gathering and influence operations but also for sabotage,” he tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “European countries need to start with basic steps: acknowledge that they have a single major threat. Once this acknowledgment happens, the next step should be decisive action – ceasing the purchase of Russian energy resources, blocking Russia’s shadow fleet, expelling Russian diplomat-spies, strengthening infrastructure protection, and investing in acquiring Ukrainian anti-drone systems, to name a few.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some analysts discuss limited, deniable counter-sabotage in response, Graef warns that “such activities carry significant risks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They can easily fuel an action–reaction cycle without generating meaningful deterrent effects,” he asserted, highlighting that the focus should remain on strengthening resilience, improving attribution, and coordinating clear response thresholds rather than “entering a covert tit-for-tat that neither deters nor stabilizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of this persistent, multi-layered threat, Stradner believes the ultimate answer lies in deterrence through strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should not fear escalations as kindness is weakness for Putin, and he only understands the language of power,” she noted, underscoring that the consequences of continued inaction and ambiguity in the face of Moscow’s “new generation warfare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Until NATO resolves the lack of clarity regarding Article 5’s threshold for acts of aggression warranting collective defense, Russia will continue to sabotage without the consequences of all-out war, and the Western response to this hybrid war will remain reactive and insufficient,” Stradner added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <title>Why an Unmanned Mission May be Most Effective in Venezuela</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-unmanned-maduro</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;Wars are increasingly fought by unconventional means. A recent example is Ukrainian insertion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-operation-spider-web&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;unmanned aerial systems (UAS)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to attack Russian airfields, launched from civilian outfitted trucks. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/mass-pager-attacks-against-hezbollah-unprecedented-blow-unclear-road-ahead&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Israeli pager attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are another example of leveraging unconventional means to achieve an outsized effect. Both examples demonstrate that unconventional methods can not only disrupt enemy forces and destroy key objectives, but also achieve tremendous psychological effects and by saturating the airspace, limit an adversaries ability to mount offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. continues a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-caribbean-us-military-buildup&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conventional military buildup&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of Venezuela, the lessons from the Ukrainian and Israeli conflicts may be prescient: the US can achieve most of our policy objectives with limited or no ground forces deployment into Venezuela. The authors assume the current U.S. administration’s objectives are centered on regime change without conventional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan forces may be well-prepared for guerilla warfare. Reports are circulating that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twz.com/news-features/russian-general-in-venezuela-leading-advisory-mission-ukraines-intel-chief&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Russian “advisors”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have been dispatched to Venezuela, and it is likely that the Venezuelan army is incorporating Russia’s lessons from Ukraine into their preparation. American forces meeting a small, well-prepared drone force could lead to unacceptable casualties, a prolonged conflict, unnecessary escalation, and international embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We suggest, therefore, that if intervention in Venezuela is forthcoming, the U.S. should adopt a strategy centered on unmanned systems. Modern combat in Ukraine and Israel provide a viable model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our proposed strategy suggests leveraging a combination of UAS and unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) to weaken the Maduro government’s internal support, and hasten favorable conditions for peace - again, assuming “regime change” or negotiated peace are the desired endstates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the U.S. Military Thinks of War&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Military uses a six-phase planning model to describe the progression of an operation or campaign. This continuum begins with Phase 0: Shape, which involves continuous peacetime activities to influence the operational environment and prepare for contingencies. As an operation develops, the force moves to Phase I: Deter, demonstrating capability and resolve to dissuade, followed by Phase II: Seize Initiative once hostilities begin, gaining access and advantage. The core combat phase is Phase III: Dominate, which involves applying overwhelming combat power to defeat the enemy force. The final stages, often requiring significant force commitment for irregular warfare, are Phase IV: Stabilize, focusing on securing the operating area and providing security, and Phase V: Enable Civil Authority, which transitions security and control back to legitimate local governance to establish a lasting peace. Technologies are used in every phase as a strategic force multiplier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposed Unmanned Systems Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase 0 should begin immediately. This phase would be centered on information collection around the capital, Caracas, and the economic epicenters, Venezuela, Maracaibo, Valencia, and Barquisimeto, as well as oil refineries, given their central importance to the Venezuelan economy. Significant real-time intelligence collection could be achieved by leveraging High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft coupled with pervasive small, ground-based sensors. UGVs would provide long-term, ground-based multi-disciplined intelligence collection capabilities, leveraging &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-drones-russia-china&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;commercial off-the-shelf technologies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (proven effective in Ukraine) to reduce risk of exposing sensitive or proprietary technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assessed trigger for escalation would be a breakdown of negotiations over a change of government. Subsequent operations would focus on precision degradation and infrastructure interdiction, designed to be quick, minimize political fallout, and avoid direct engagement with Venezuelan forces. Generally, operations would seek to scale between Phase 1 - Deter, and Phase 3 - Dominate, to apply and then relieve pressure on the Venezuelan government and population as needed to degrade political will and popular support. Operations should be carefully crafted, and targets thoughtfully selected, not just for military effect, but for their psychological and political impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerial and Electronic Warfare Dominance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first actions would be entirely aerial, focused on blinding the Venezuelan government and shaping persistent intelligence, all while demonstrating the ability to dominate without causing significant destruction. The U.S. could suppress air defenses using high-altitude, stealth drones, and specialized EW drones to undermine government influence and degrade command and control. Targets would include Venezuela's air defense systems, mostly Russian S-300VM and Buk-M2E missile batteries, and radar networks. Key locations would be targeted with precision-guided munitions or overwhelmed and jammed by EW drones before kinetic strikes to establish air superiority for subsequent UAS waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What national security news are you missing today?

By severing communication links between the military high command and field units, the U.S. could cause decentralized chaos, which would degrade the will to fight. Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) could contain Venezuelan forces, targeting the fleet to deny freedom of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given instability in Venezuela and the Maduro Government’s demonstrated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-rejected-maduro-requests-call-options-narrow-venezuela-leader-sources-say-2025-12-01/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;willingness to enter into discussions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, well-sequenced escalation and deescalation may provide the necessary impetus to achieve the desired effect. Minimizing destruction up to this juncture reduces the subsequent burden of rebuilding, which would increase popular support for a replacement government. Minimizing damage would also reduce the likelihood of causing unintended regional instability through large-scale human displacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their extended battery life and ability to recharge with onboard solar panels or from civilian power sources, UGVs provide an ideal baseline for extended operations, providing prolonged ground-based intelligence and surveillance. Information from onboard sensors, long-term intelligence collection, could provide timely battle damage assessments, and would shape planning for subsequent operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well-Timed Precision Strikes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small UAS loaded with precision explosive and cyber and EW payloads could be loaded onto UGV and transported deep within the country, where they would be staged for well-timed, precision operations to set conditions for negotiations. Disabling power to cause temporary service blackouts, or disrupting and corrupting government information campaigns would allow the U.S. to control the narrative. These precision operations should be choreographed and limited to eliminate harm to civilians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Precision strikes launched from UGVs could damage government buildings and political headquarters, timed for maximum media coverage, to demonstrate penetration and weakness. Cellular towers could be struck with small munitions to inconvenience and frustrate the population. These limited actions could continue near indefinitely, and would reinforce the narrative that Maduro is weak and incapable, increasing the likelihood of a timely resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UGVs with an explosive payload could be covertly controlled over cellular networks over extended distances, to strike key locations such as bridges, military installations or troop concentrations deep within Venezuela. In the event of a troop deployment, UGV could also be outfitted with weapon platforms such as machine guns or grenade launchers, for force protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/a&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today.

There are two options should we choose to proceed. The first is a conventional war, with high financial cost, significant political risk and moderate risk of casualties. The second option is to leverage our growing unmanned systems arsenal, where financial costs will be relatively low, and the risk of casualties will be minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lessons from modern conflicts in Ukraine and Israel overwhelmingly provide a model for moving towards an agile, unmanned systems-centric strategy. This agile approach, moving from pervasive intelligence collection to targeted electronic warfare and precision kinetic strikes, if choreographed with other effects, would exert maximum political and psychological pressure. It also minimizes collateral damage by avoiding direct military engagement with Venezuelan forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strategy has several advantages: it drastically reduces the risk of unacceptable casualties for American forces, and it minimizes the destructive aftermath that traditionally prolongs conflict and burdens post-conflict reconstruction. An unmanned systems strategy also enables the U.S. to move fluidly between deterring and dominating to maximize effects, and serves as a strong deterrent against countries who might doubt America’s ability to fight and win in modern combat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the choice to intervene will always be a political one. However, if such action is deemed necessary, adopting a nearly exclusive unmanned strategy offers a path to achieving a political end-state quickly and cleanly. It is a recognition that the future of modern warfare is defined not by the size of a conventional buildup, but by the strategic, ethical, and precise application of unmanned systems to effect change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given that China is the world’s largest emitter and has a high carbon intensity, some assume that its trade war with the United States, which has shifted production to third countries, would have environmental benefits. In fact, the conflict has increased carbon dioxide emissions in developing and advanced economies alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
