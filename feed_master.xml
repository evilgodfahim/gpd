      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Western consensus on how to erode China's industrial dominance and &quot;de-risk&quot; supply chains deserves a harder look. Reducing dependence on China is not as simple as switching a few suppliers; it demands the cultivation of comparable industrial density, including supplier networks, skills, tooling, and patient finance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the announcement of an interim trade deal between the US and India, hopes are high that the bruising confrontation initiated by President Donald Trump last year is coming to an end. But while the deal may ease tensions, trust – the essential currency of any strategic partnership – is unlikely to be restored any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>After New START: America Weighs a New Nuclear Strategy</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/after-new-start-america-weighs-a-new-nuclear-strategy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;“Militarily, the expiration [last Thursday] of New START [2010 Treaty with Russia] enables the United States to take parallel steps. We will complete our ongoing nuclear modernization programs that were initiated while New START entered into force. The United States also retains non-deployed nuclear capacity [some 1,900 stored nuclear warheads and bombs] that can be used to address the emerging security environment, if directed by the President. Such actions include expanding current forces, diversifying our capabilities, developing and fielding new theater-range nuclear forces, and adapting our extended deterrence posture as necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Thomas DiNanno speaking in Geneva last Friday at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day earlier, in a post on &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Truth Social&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, President Trump offered this arms control idea: “Rather than extend ‘NEW START’ (A badly negotiated deal by the United States that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future. Thank you for your attention to this matter! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having written about nuclear weapons and covered arms control efforts over the past 60+ years, I thought I would join with others to offer some ideas on where we are now and where we ought to be headed. But rather than doing it alone, I thought I would include some matters raised by former U.S. government nuclear weapons and arms control experts who testified last Tuesday before the Senate Arms Services Committee during a hearing on the post-New START treaty environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with who is at Trump’s future negotiating table. Trump and other U.S. officials have said China along with Russia has to be there, although so far the Chinese have refused to discuss their nuclear programs. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in response to the Chinese participating idea, said he would then want the United Kingdom and France, two other nuclear powers, also included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last week’s Senate Armed Services hearing, Rose Gottemoeller, the lead U.S. negotiator for New START and now Lecturer at Stanford University and Research Fellow at the Hoover Institute, gave what I believe would be the best ideas for the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said, “I do not support trying to do a trilateral negotiation. I believe that these negotiations [with Russia and China] should be done in parallel. We have 50 plus years of experience limiting and reducing nuclear weapons with the Russians. We can continue that kind of process [to include tactical and hypersonic nuclear weapons] with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gottemoeller added, “And by the way, I agree that non-strategic nuclear weapons [should be included]. We did not constrain non-strategic nuclear weapons in the New START treaty. It was not designed for that purpose. So to fault it for not controlling those weapons is a bit bizarre, but nevertheless, I agreed with the Trump administration during the first term when they said we need an all-warhead limit in the next negotiation. I think that is definitely the priority we need to proceed on with the Russians.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gottemoeller also said, “It's been my recent experience working with them [the Chinese] in track two [non-U.S. Government] settings that they seem very interested in trying to figure out ways to begin a conversation with the United States about nuclear risks… developing better communications, links with them at the strategic level, hotline arrangements, these types of things. I think they are valuable to begin a conversation about the necessity of controlling nuclear weapons at the negotiating table and [for the Chinese] not being so un-transparent about what they're doing with their modernization. That has to be the first and foremost objective talking to them about what their intentions are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, “I've already spoken about the Chinese. I think they are willing to talk to us now, but it is about risk reduction and the beginning of more predictability and transparency about their nuclear objectives,” matters that up-to-now they have refused to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picking up Gottemoeller’s idea for China at the Senate hearing was another witness, retired-Adm. Charles A. Richard, former commander of the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), and incoming chief executive officer of the Institute for Defense Analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard told the Senators, “I think that is an excellent starting point for a conversation with China. There are terms like confidence building and transparency that I would certainly endorse. But fundamentally it comes back to how do you responsibly operate weapon systems with this magnitude of destructive potential. That is to everyone's benefit including China. And I think that makes an excellent starting point for diplomacy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gottemoeller/Richard approach reminded me of discussions I had had back in the early 1970s with Paul Nitze when he was part of the Nixon team negotiating SALT I. Nitze told me the Soviet negotiators who were Foreign Office diplomats had little knowledge about nuclear weapons thereby leaving most of the negotiations to the Russian hard-line military. As a result, the Americans had to educate the Soviet diplomats about the destructive power of these weapons to get them more active in the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Secretary DiNanno in his Friday Disarmament Conference Geneva speech said future discussions meant “taking into account all Russian nuclear weapons [strategic and tactical], both novel and existing strategic systems.” DiNanno specifically mentioned Russia’s “nuclear-powered Skyfall cruise missile and its doomsday Poseidon [nuclear strategic] torpedo. New START constrained neither of these systems and Russia has successfully tested both within the last few months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with Russia and China, two potentially peer nuclear powers, both Gottemoeller and Richard agreed about the need for the U.S. to increase its nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gottemoeller said, “I actually agree with the notion that we need to think carefully about the threat that is presented by two nuclear peers by China and by the Russian Federation going forward. And we need to make judicious choices juxtaposed against the other demands on our defense budget. And I mentioned the conventional force posture, but also the new technologies that are coming our way and must be judiciously incorporated into our new weapon systems as well as the whole arena of cyber threats and how we are going to contest the Russians and the China Chinese in that space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard was much more specific. He said, “I think that the United States needs to immediately start taking steps, steps that are currently precluded by the New START treaty…to include uploading [currently stored U.S. nuclear] warheads to our intercontinental ballistic missiles, removing covers off the four [launch] tubes on our Trident [strategic] submarines that are currently empty [of strategic nuclear sea-launched ballistic missiles], and several other posture steps that should be taken now, and not a year from now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Geneva Friday, Under Secretary DiNanno raised questions about “Russian and Chinese nuclear testing in violation of their respective moratoria on yield-producing nuclear tests.” He said, “The annual U.S. compliance report has previously assessed that Russia has failed to maintain its testing moratorium by conducting supercritical nuclear weapons tests.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DiNanno also disclosed, “Today, I can reveal that the U.S. Government is aware that China has conducted nuclear explosive tests, including preparing for tests with designated yields in the hundreds of tons…China has used decoupling – a method to decrease the effectiveness of seismic monitoring – to hide their activities from the world. China conducted one such yield producing nuclear test on June 22 of 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, at the Senate hearing, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), talked about the Nevada National Security Sites where the U.S. has carried out its nuclear testing saying, “Today the site's underground laboratory is undergoing major mining and construction to provide enhanced capabilities for sub-critical experiments [that are allowed because they don’t involve a nuclear yield] and it will host in the near future two of the most capable weapons radiographic systems in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosen added, “Together with other efforts, these machines will provide greater certainty and data about the performance of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. Far better data, experts say, than the information that could be gleaned if the U.S. were to break the [1992] moratorium [on underground nuclear testing] and conduct an explosive nuclear test, as the President [Trump] and some in his orbit have advocated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Richard to agree that while he was STRATCOM commander four years ago, U.S. sub-critical experiments and robust computer modeling provided data that led him to certify the military effectiveness of our stockpile without the need to resume explosive testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gottemoeller added, “President Putin himself said that they would only resume testing on a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;reciprocal basis with the United States. So, I would expect that to be the outcome. And I do expect that it would disadvantage us, you know, because we conducted more explosive nuclear tests than any nuclear weapon state. We have more data available to us with which we are able to do a massive amount of calculation and other activities in order to assure our stockpile is safe, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;secure and effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gottemoeller and Richard both delivered their own views on the advantages of arms control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Stable deterrence is driven by predictability and nuclear negotiations done right deliver predictability,” Gottemoeller said. She added, “The effect comes about because restraints on our opponents reached through agreement bolster predictability which in turn supports our nuclear forces in their drive for reliable, stable and effective deterrence. Lack of predictability by contrast feeds uncertainty about the status of the nuclear forces among our adversaries, which means we may end up spending more than we have to on nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard said, “Our entire nuclear deterrence posture is designed to, by threat of escalation, convince your opponent -- have a perception in your opponent's mind -- that restraint, inaction is their least bad course of action. And that has been successful for over 60 years in deterring not only nuclear attack on the United States and our allies, but has made a great contribution to the deterrence of great power war.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to close with a reminder that I often use when discussing nuclear weapons. That is to remind readers the original handful of nuclear weapons were built by U.S. scientists, including Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, as terror weapons, to kill as many people as possible to end a war – not to fight one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as ret.-Adm. Richard noted above, despite the much too large a number of both tactical and strategic nuclear weapons that have since been built and exist today, none has been used in a war situation since two were used in 1945, and they did end a war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who's reading this? 500K+ dedicated national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three failed missions in a year have created a reputational crisis for the Indian Space Research Organization, jeopardizing India’s position in a crowded commercial market. Given the ISRO’s critical role in supporting development, innovation, security, and national pride, the agency needs to pursue a strategic reset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a world of asymmetrical power dynamics and deep interdependencies, the only path to stability lies in binding rules, credible institutions, and enduring alliances. Donald Trump’s rejection of this basic truth – reflected in his dealings with Russia – augurs an age of volatility from which China will emerge a clear winner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/washington-dc-january-31-2024-commander-of-the-u-s-cyber-command-army-gen-paul-nakasone-testifies-before-the-house-selec.jpg?id=64044951&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C258%2C0%2C259&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT INTERVIEW --&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;General Paul Nakasone (ret.) has spent a career at the very center of America's most invisible battlefields. He has served as both director of the National Security Agency and commander of U.S. Cyber Command, two roles that sit at the intersection of intelligence, technology, and modern warfare. During his tenure, cyber operations moved from the shadows into daily strategic competition as the United States confronted persistent threats from China, Russia, Iran, and criminal networks operating at a nation state scale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;General Nakasone prioritized a doctrine of persistent engagement, challenging adversaries continuously in cyberspace rather than reacting to incidents after the fact. It was a shift that reshaped how the U.S. thinks about deterrence, escalation, and defense in a digital age. It feels even more important today, as artificial intelligence accelerates decision-making and blurs the lines between peace and conflict.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since retiring, General Nakasone is continuing his mission as the founding director of Vanderbilt University's Institute of National Security. He also serves as a board member and advisor to some of the world's leading technology companies. General Nakasone is also being recognized with this year’s Impact in Cyber Award, being presented at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cipherbriefhonors.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief Honors Dinner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in Washington in March.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I spoke with General Nakasone on Friday for the State Secrets Podcast. Below are highlights from the conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity. You can also listen to the full interview of the State Secrets podcast available wherever you listen to podcasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;expert-block-container expert-list&quot;&gt;

          General Paul Nakasone (Ret.) served as Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and Commander of the U.S. Cyber Command from May 2018 to February 2024.
    	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE INTERVIEW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: You've argued that persistent engagement really changed the cyber battlefield. Looking back, where do you think it succeeded beyond expectations and where did it fall short against adversaries like China and Russia?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I think when we think about cyber, remember, this is a very dynamic environment. When I took over as both the commander and director in 2018, we were coming out of the 2016 elections. And one of the guidance points from President Trump and the secretary of defense was that we can't let this happen again. We cannot have a foreign nation attempt to influence our elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We looked at what we had done and what had occurred and we came to the realization that this is not an episodic event where we can just come and do our business and then leave. We must be engaged every single day. And so this idea of persistently engaging with our adversaries was born. It worked quite well in terms of the security of the 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2024 elections. It's worked against a series of different adversaries, Iran, Russia and China. But I think the point is that the environment is dynamic. To your point, as we look at greater scale and scope of adversaries like the Chinese, persistent engagement must also change. We need new partners, new techniques and new technologies. Those are things that we must be able to look at and be able to practice every single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Midterm elections are coming up later this year. There is certain to be a lot of politics and political messaging around those elections. What are you focused on strictly from a cybersecurity awareness perspective when it comes to securing the midterms?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As a private citizen, I'm very, very interested in what foreign adversaries might try to do to influence our election. That's what the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Commander focused outside of the United States. I want to make sure that there is no nation that can influence what goes on in our electoral processes. That was what I was doing as a military member, and that's what I'm focused on now as a private citizen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Is there more that you can do from the private sector side in terms education? What are you trying to do at Vanderbilt?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We're really trying to do three things at the Institute of National Security. First, we’re building the next generation of national security leaders. Whether those leaders are in the private sector or the public sector - it's very, very important that we're able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second thing we're trying to do is to provide pragmatism to theory. This is one of the things that Vanderbilt and our Institute takes great pride in by saying, ‘&lt;em&gt;Hey, there's a lot of theory out there, but let's make a pragmatic approach to securing the critical infrastructure or looking at new ways in terms of being able to identify and solve hard problems&lt;/em&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the third thing we do is we educate. I mean, that's what great universities do. That's what Vanderbilt does. Whether we’re educating our students or whether we’re educating our faculty or whether we’re educating the broader public, that's what we're trying to do at the Institute of National Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Cyber deterrence is an issue that comes up a lot. Is cyber deterrence something that exists today or are we still stuck in this model of continuous contact without any clear red lines?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I don't think cyber deterrence is the same thing as nuclear deterrence. Certainly, that's not an analogy I would use. But here's what I would use: we need to be very, very proactive in what we do to be able to secure the domain that we utilize for so many things every single day. And so again, this idea of persistent engagement, I would tell you that that's the right way we've got to approach it. But we need greater partnerships, we need greater technology with greater scope. And I think there are new ideas that need to come to fruition here. So, as the national cyber director gets ready to release his national strategy, I look forward to what he's going to say about how we involve academia or the private sector or private citizens in terms of what we can do to secure this domain that's so important to our nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: There's a whole lot of breath holding over when that national strategy will be released. What are some of the key components of the new strategy that you hope to see?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I'm hopeful to see a very, very strong focus on partnerships. What is it that the government does best? What is it that the private sector does best? What do we, as private citizens need to be able to do? I'm also looking for a component of, ‘How do we look at this and look at our threats differently?’ There's a broad range of threats that we face in cyber states, nation states, non-nation states, criminals. These are all different areas that need different approaches. I'm looking for a strategy that can take care of all of that. And any great strategy should motivate us, should make us think, ‘&lt;em&gt;Wow, this is exactly the way we want to be able to do things and to conduct ourselves to solve these tough problems.&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: You talk a lot about partnerships. I'm proud to say that Sir Richard Moore, who just recently stepped down as the chief of MI6, is also a fellow honoree at this year's &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cipherbriefhonors.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cipher Brief Honors Awards&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; for his impact through alliances, because alliances and partnerships are so critical. Can you talk a little bit more about how you see partnerships evolving in the future given how dramatically technology is changing the battlefield in cyber?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Before I talk about that, let me just take a step back and congratulate my fellow honorees, Gilman Louie and Sir Richard Moore and Janet Braun and David Ignatius. These are true giants of what has gone on. I think to be mentioned in this same category of honorees, is really very humbling.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I congratulate each one of them. And I'm really looking forward to the HONORS dinner on the 13th of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regards to partnerships, we just had the honor of hosting Sir Richard Moore at Vanderbilt University for a talk. And one of the things that we both agree on very strongly is that we're much better together than we are separately. What I'm always trying to emphasize in partnerships is that we can do things much better collectively than we can alone. As you take a look at what Richard Moore has done throughout his entire life, it's been a series of incredible partnerships that he's been able to foster. I feel the same way. This partnership needs to expand, it needs to be broader and it needs to be inclusive of more nations, more technologies, more industries that can help us be even more secure in the future.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Let’s talk about China. What do think Beijing has learned from Russia's performance in Ukraine and do you think anything surprised them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I think the first thing that they probably were surprised at is how much the United States intelligence community knew about what was going to take place on the 24th of February 2022. And the administration released that information publicly. I'm sure that shocked the Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second thing I think they learned is that the Russians were not that good. And what has occurred over the past three plus years of seeing the loss of life and the loss of equipment, that must have really provided a pause to the Chinese as they think about the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third thing that they've clearly demonstrated is that they've learned they cannot stop supporting Russia. They are the number one supporter of what Russia has been able to do in Ukraine - and continues to do. And even with that, they have not been able to overcome the Ukrainians. Those are the three lessons that I think the Chinese probably have thought about as they look back on the three plus years of this conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Do you think China is more likely to use cyber operations as a prelude to any kind of kinetic conflict with Taiwan?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;One of the things that I think the department and certainly I have agreed with is that probably the first shots of any future conflicts are going to take place in cyber and space. And I would include space in that as well. Space is a competitive advantage for our nation, just as cyber is. But as any adversary looks to the future, I don't think they say, ‘&lt;em&gt;Hey, let's go ahead and just wait for this conflict to take place. Let's make sure if we're going to take on the United States that we nullify&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;their competitive advantages&lt;/em&gt;’ and the competitive advantages begin with space and cyber.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Kevin Mandia, whom you’ve worked with over the course of your career, told how incredibly good Russia is in cyber. They once sort of dominated the cyber conversation. Do you think they're still a top tier cyber adversary? Or has the war in Ukraine exposed a lot of their structural weaknesses?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I would agree with Kevin that they are a top power in terms of their cyber capabilities, but they're not the best power. Of our adversaries, clearly, it's the Chinese. In the sense of their scale and their scope of what they're able to do, it's much different than what the Russians can do. But there's no one, none of our adversaries today can replace what the Russians are able to do in the information operations space. They are masters at it. And I think that's one of the ways I think about vigilance in the future. I think about how we protect ourselves from that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Let's talk about technology. You focus so much on this. AI is rapidly changing, intelligence collection and analysis also. What do you think is the most dangerous misconception that policymakers have about AI's role in national security right now?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; If we're going to talk about AI, the first thing we need to do is return to the advent of ChatGPT in November of 2022. What have we seen in terms of change? And this is one of the things that I think is important for all of us to realize in what a little over three years, we have seen prompts go to text, to video, to recordings, to reasoning, to deep research. And now to agents. This is the landscape upon which we see AI operating today. I think one of the great misconceptions about artificial intelligence is believing we can just go ahead and put in a prompt and that’s all that’s going to occur. It's not that simple. It still requires a human component to what you're going to do. If you want to be a power in AI, you need four things. You need chips, you need data, you need energy. And the final thing is you need talent. And those are the four components that I think most people don't think about when they think about artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: At what point do you think AI stops being an enabler and starts becoming a vulnerability, especially inside military and intelligence decision-making loops?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Artificial intelligence is just like cyber. It’s really just like any capability. It has both its strengths and weaknesses. If we focus on agents, they will able to do all of these things for us. But you're going to want to understand what they're doing, and then protect those agents from those that may try to make the agents do something they shouldn't be doing. One of the things that artificial intelligence shows us is that there are great capabilities here. But there are also incredible challenges with regard to being able to have visibility on them, have control over them, protect them, and then be able to truly understand what they've done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Should the U.S. be willing to accept less explainability in AI systems in exchange for speed and advantage?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever we talk about a technology, there must be transparency of that technology. We must have a degree of security and feeling of safety that this technology is going to be utilized and that it comports with our norms and values - that it does things we want it to do. This is important. When I think about that, speed is an incredibly important capability of artificial intelligence. But I would also say security is the other ‘S’ that we can't ever forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: What does the next five or ten years look like to you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; One of the things we don't talk a lot about that I'm very excited about is being able to use artificial intelligence in an enterprise manner, being able to use these models to take a look at code and correct bad code, that is really the responsibility for the vast majority of weaknesses in our cybersecurity posture and is one of the things that we should be able to correct immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second thing is, wouldn't it be wonderful if we can continue to use artificial intelligence to discover new cures, new medicines for diseases that we have not been able to be able to address in our lifetimes? And the final thing I'm really excited about is using artificial intelligence for education - being able to look at a broad classroom of users – both the smartest and those that are struggling – and giving them the same ability to advance given the fact that this artificial intelligence is almost like a tutor to those students. That's a fairly heady thing that I think about when I think about the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: You also sit on several boards and serve as an advisor to a number of companies. I'm wondering from that position, do you see the cyber landscape any differently than you did when you were serving in government?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;One of the things I’ve certainly realized, and I realized it to a degree as the director of NSA and as commander of U.S. Cyber Command, but that I realize even more fully now, is the power of ingenuity within our private sector. If you look at what is being done in places like Silicon Valley and Austin and Seattle and Boston and in Nashville and other places throughout the United States, it's truly amazing. And I say that as we look at our future, one of the things that I always emphasize to&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;audiences is that our government should be focused on the things that we have competitive advantage in. And everything else - we should have our partners do. So, I'll bring that back to the National Security Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one breaks code or makes code better than the NSA. Everything else, we should have partners with. That's a little bit of my realization as I've made the journey from military officer to private citizen.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Now that you’re in the private sector, how do you feel about the dual-hatted role over NSA and Cyber Command? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; My thoughts on the dual hat really haven't changed since I was the commander and the director for six years. And that is within a domain of cyberspace where speed, agility and unity of effort really matter. Having one person that directs both organizations, one that has all of the authorities to do what we need to do to defend and to provide offensive capabilities in cyberspace, and one that has the intelligence components and capabilities that are second to none in the intelligence community, is important. Having one person direct that and say, this is what we need to focus on, is an advantage to the nation, particularly when we have a series of adversaries that at times have larger components than what we do. I think that this is really the secret sauce for what we do in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: What lessons have you learned from that model?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I want to share two lessons that I think are relevant for those that are in the private sector. The first is among the best pieces of advice I received early on in my tenure. It was from a retired four-star who said to me, &lt;em&gt;‘Paul, these two jobs are easy.’&lt;/em&gt; And it was like, you know, day three of my tenure and I could barely find my desk. And he said something that I never forgot. He said, ‘&lt;em&gt;What is it that only you can do that the organizations depend on you to do? And once you figure that out, you'll focus your time on those things.&lt;/em&gt;’ It took me a little while to really understand truly what it was that only I could do as both the head of NSA and of Cyber Command. But once I did, that's what I focused on. And that really allowed me to be able to shine a light on the areas that we had to and to get after and understand better the challenges to our nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second piece of advice I received was also really important. And that was that you must be able to communicate. You must be able to talk to a number of different audiences; Congress or the White House or the Secretary of Defense or your own workforce. I really learned very early on that being able to communicate was one of the things that I had to do effectively. And being able to communicate not only with those in government, but also the public sector and for someone who spent his life in the intelligence community, talking in a room of people who were listening and asking questions was something that I had to become comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: NSA is going through a shift since the former commander was dismissed last year and don’t have a confirmed leader yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I'm really excited that Josh Rudd now has been to his confirmation hearings. I would anticipate that he's been voted out of committees, that he'd be confirmed very, very soon. And having a confirmed leader of both organizations is really the true good news story here moving forward. We need to look forward, not in the rear-view mirror, and being able to think about what are the things that he's going to need to have from a broad area of partners to help him be successful. I think about anything that we can do to make his tenure even more successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: When you held those roles, there was really an evolution in the partnerships between the private sector and government. Do you see that evolving under the next director as well?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I think it must. If you're going to look at having capacity and capability in cyberspace, you must have a series of partnerships with the private sector. And that includes both the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command. But I think the partnerships don't start there. It's also international partners that I think that are really important. I think that there's a series of academic partners. Certainly, we at Vanderbilt University look forward to being a great partner to the new commander and director. But I also think there are a series of partnerships today that perhaps we haven't even thought about. Partnerships with perhaps non-government organizations or partnerships with other entities that have placement and stature within cyberspace that can assist us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You've worked for multiple administrations and you've done a tremendous job remaining very apolitical. In an era of election interference, of deepfakes and information warfare, how do you think the military stays neutral while defending the system? This is something that's on everyone's mind in Washington and you really seem to be very successfully navigating a difficult space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; First, I think that that the U.S. military and our military officers need to remember what has been an incredibly successful civil-military partnership. And remember that we work for our elected leaders. And I think it's important that we're very, very conscious of anything that we say, whether we're in uniform or out of uniform, that can be construed as being critical or being supportive or anything like that with regards to our political leaders. We have a mission to defend the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also have a focus outside the United States and being able to continue to do that is something that's very, very important to us. And continued civil discourse is one of the things that I really hope continues to improve and being able to listen to people and understand that they may have a radically different opinion than your own. Listening is the first part of understanding. I think that would be one of the things that I hope our future leaders continue to remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Let’s close with what’s happening outside the U.S. If you had to describe to the average American how serious the threat is from China, how would describe it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I think when you consider China or any adversary, one of the things you should measure is what their capabilities are in terms of their military, their economic stature, their informational powers, and even their diplomatic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at China today, think about their economy. Fifty years ago, when President Nixon went to China, they had a gross domestic product of $114 billion. Today,&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;it's approaching $18 trillion. And to give you perspective, our gross domestic product in the United States is about $25 trillion. There's been incredible, incredible growth in their economy. Today, they're the number one manufacturer in the world. The next nine countries cannot equal the percentage of manufacturing that takes place in China every single day. Militarily, they have the largest Navy in the world - not the best - but the largest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at their information capabilities, think about TikTok.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Over 60 % of the United States clicks on TikTok every single day to get their news. And then if you look at their diplomatic prowess, they've been able to establish a series of partnerships through the Belt and Road Initiative and being able to obviously bring on several partners that were never ever available to them in the past. This is a nation that has increasing capabilities and has designs not just on being a regional power but being a global power.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's something that we as Americans need to think very hard about. And if you look at our values and what we stand for, they are dramatically different than what China stands for.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Is there anything on your mind that I didn't ask you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen. Nakasone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Let me just come back to what I do as my focus and my passion right now, which is continuing to educate the next generation of young people that are going to be part of our national security apparatus. People ask me whether I’m positive about our future. I would tell you, I am extremely positive about our future because I get to work with some of the smartest young people in America at Vanderbilt University every single day. When I look at the 18 to 20-year-olds, 22-year-olds that are thinking about the opportunities and challenges that face them, this is truly one of the things that I think provides a great dynamism to our nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we close today, I would tell you that I'm incredibly optimistic as I look to the future with the young people who are coming up and I look forward to seeing what they're going to do in their lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert insights into national security in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump’s pick to take over as chair of the Federal Reserve in May is preoccupied with moral hazard, the concern that Fed balance-sheet expansion encourages risky behavior by banks, inflates asset prices, and promotes fiscal profligacy. But while moral-hazard risk is a valid concern, so is financial-meltdown risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has long been reasonable to assume that central banks’ incremental diversification of their reserve holdings would erode the US dollar’s hegemonic position only over the long run. But with the addition of heightened market skepticism about the greenback, we could find ourselves in uncharted waters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although emerging markets have made great strides in improving their economic-policy frameworks and enhancing credibility, this is no time for complacency. After all, most have benefited from favorable external conditions, and they are still on a slower growth path than before the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Looking to the future, a world where everyone can live securely and with options – as opposed to just subsisting – is within reach, but will require emerging economies to continue expanding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next US Federal Reserve chair seems to think that the large size of the central bank’s balance sheet reflects a discretionary policy choice which can and should be reversed. In reality, however, the Fed's balance sheet has become part of the financial system’s core infrastructure, and shrinking it would carry serious risks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;European leaders seem increasingly convinced that, to succeed in the 21st century, they must reshape Europe's economy in America’s image. But the American brand of &quot;competitiveness&quot; contributes to major imbalances and far-reaching harm, which the European Union can avoid by embracing effective competition policy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following aggressive lobbying by the Trump administration, more than 145 countries agreed to give big US multinationals a free pass under the global corporate minimum tax rules that were agreed in 2021.

      <title>Xi Jinping Tightens Grip as China’s Military Purge Deepens</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/xi-jinping-tightens-grip-as-chinas-military-purge-deepens</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;In China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) “commands the gun”, and Chinese President Xi Jinping controls the one million members of the CCP. In October 2022, Mr. Xi was elected to an unprecedented third term as Secretary General of the CCP and President of the People’s Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Xi succeeded Hu Jintao as Secretary General in November 2012 and immediately proceeded to expel Politburo member Bo Xilai from the CCP and Zhou Yongkang in 2014, responsible for China’s security services and one of nine-members of the powerful Standing Committee of the Politburo. This was the beginning of Mr. Xi’s anti-corruption campaign – and the removal of political rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anti-corruption campaign continues, with over 115 senior officials investigated in 2025 and reportedly over 60 punished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what got the public’s attention was the removal of defense ministers Wei Feng he and Li Shangfu in October 2023 and June 2024. Then in 2025 the removal of General He Wei Dong, Vice Chairman of the nine-member Central Military Commission (CMC), for “serious violations of Party discipline” and Admiral Miao Hua, Director of the CMC’s Political Work Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also removed from the CCP in October 2025 were eight additional senior military officials, to include Lin Xiangyang, former commander of the Eastern Theatre Command responsible for Taiwan; Wang Houbin, former commander of the Rocket Force, responsible for China’s nuclear and missile programs and Wang Chunning, former commander of the People’s Armed Police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 1970s and 80s, both General He Weidong and Admiral Miao Hua were assigned to the 31 Group Army in Fujian Province, responsible for any potential military operations against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, in January 2026, Mr. Xi continued with his purge of the military, with the removal of General Zhang Youxia, senior Vice Chairman of the CMC and China’s most senior general and General Liu Zhenli, Chief of CMC’s Joint Staff Department responsible for planning and operations. Both generals are accused of committing severe violations of party discipline and state laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Zhang is also a member of the Politburo and a close associate of Mr. Xi. Their fathers fought together in the Chinese civil war with Mao Zedong’s forces that eventually prevailed in 1949. For Mr. Xi to purge a fellow “princeling” – descendants of revolutionary elders – must have shocked senior officials in Beijing wondering when does this hollowing-out of seniors in the military stop, and if they’re next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Zhang. as vice chairman of the CMC, had direct responsibility for military strategies concerning Taiwan. He was responsible for planning for potential conflict with Taiwan. General Zhang was an outspoken proponent of forceful unification, saying the military would “show no mercy” if Taiwan declared independence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late December 2025, China’s military conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan – “Justice Mission 2025.” This was the sixth major exercise since 2022, simulating a full blockade of Taiwan, with naval vessels and aircraft testing joint operational capabilities; deploying warships, bombers, and fighter jets to encircle Taiwan. The exercise was designed to test China’s ability to seal off Taiwan’s major ports, while simulating strikes on land and sea targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These “gray zone” tactics were meant to intimidate the public and exhaust Taiwan’s defense resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is quite possible that Mr. Xi removed generals Zhang Youxia, He Wei Dong and Liu Zhenli, all members of the 7-member CMC designed for rapid decision-making and China’s highest military command, with Mr. Xi as its chairman, due to disagreements over Taiwan. All these generals, and general Lin Xiangyang, former commander of the Eastern Theatre Command responsible for Taiwan, were responsible for military operations against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Xi demands loyalty from all CCP and military colleagues. It’s possible that Mr. Xi’s military colleagues were pushing for a kinetic move against Taiwan in 2027, a date that Mr. Xi said China would have the military capability to kinetically move against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears to me that Mr. Xi was not prepared for a kinetic move against Taiwan, despite what his military generals were strongly advocating. And when Mr. Xi got push back from his generals, he removed them. In China, the CCP controls the gun, and Mr. Xi controls the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The author is the former Associate Director of National Intelligence.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In America today, journalism still exists, but the chain that once ran from reporting to shared reality to institutional response has begun to break apart. The consequence is a democracy where truth no longer matters, because facts can be published, verified, and still fail to trigger a response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Secrets to Sensors: Why Open Source Data Must Drive Modern Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/from-secrets-to-sensors-why-open-source-data-must-drive-modern-intelligence</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE BLUF / COLUMN — &lt;/strong&gt;The Department of Defense is on a tear to revamp technology for warfighters. Secretary Hegseth signed an AI strategy on 9 January and prior to that he called for an Enterprise Command and Control Program Office that would provide a real time battlespace picture for military commanders, something that has been talked about for years but never completed. The urgency is clear. The intelligence community must play a large part in this Department of Defense technology transformation if it wants to remain relevant to the warfighter and decision makers. Key for the intelligence community will be to fundamentally rethink its relationship with open source data. To be most useful for the decision makers and operators, the intelligence community must rebuild itself on the backbone of open source data and commercial technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only is data important but because of the volume and complexity of that data, so is the technology that can sift through the data. Public domain data must be the first place to gather trends and threat warnings that feed the many watch centers across the department of defense and intelligence community which will be the basis of the enterprise command and control picture. Much of the technology already exists for sifting through the data; fusing it into one picture will be a feat. The intelligence community, however, must make cultural changes first to accept the importance of the technology and public data, and secondly to acquire the technology and data on a timely basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intelligence community has struggled with adopting the reality that to remain relevant, it must embrace publicly and commercially available data into its threat and warning process and use the powerful technologies that the commercial world is developing to sift through that data. There has been much work in this area across the intelligence community and some of it has been groundbreaking but the work has not been comprehensive, integrated, or fast. There are boutique enterprises that attempt to develop their own high-tech way forward but when it comes to scaling such technology across the intelligence community or within the Defense Intelligence Enterprise, the hurdles are huge. Each intelligence agency claims its own security issues and erects fences against cross intelligence technology modernization. Even organizations like the Defense Innovation Unit or IN-Q-TEL focus on discreet requirements, not the wholesale cultural change needed to bring in the latest commercial technology that can support warning and security. As the largest part of the intelligence community, the Defense Intelligence Enterprise needs to lead the way in developing a high tech, open source, data rich environment for its customer base. Military commanders need a real-time, complete, and high-quality battlespace picture to quickly make informed decisions, take direct actions, and assess the high volume of potential targets and threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capabilities that are available to do this are endless. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning Against Biological Events&lt;/strong&gt;: Technical sensors and human sensors worldwide record biological events and provide data on disease upticks and hazardous environments. Environmental &amp; Biosensors are global and are critical tools for detecting, quantifying, and interpreting dynamic changes in environmental or biological systems. There are multiple crowd sourced disease outbreak platforms. Biosensors, local reporting, and crowdsourcing technologies monitor everything from air and water quality to metabolic and cellular activity in real time. Technology can combine these complex platforms and sensors to read the data and provide intelligence analysts a real time global map of trends ad anomalies, that once fused with other intelligence could lead to early detection of a pandemic, an industrial or environmental bio event, or development of a WMD. Such a real time platform, based on open source data would also support military and clandestine operations by providing information to the operator about the environment they will encounter. Such maps are currently available either through a subscription or to the public but not one that fuses all this data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans and Sensors&lt;/strong&gt;: Multiple commercial enterprises are employing social media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLOCKINT&lt;/strong&gt;: Blockchain intelligence (BLOCKINT) is mission-critical to modern defense and counterintelligence operations, supporting analysis and targeting on such issues as terrorism financing, disinformation campaigns, and espionage. BLOCKINT can be an important tool to detect adversary threats and to perpetrate grey zone activity against adversaries. BLOCKINT enables proactive disruption —not just retrospective analysis — allowing agencies to deny, degrade, and disrupt threat actors before funds are fully laundered or operationalized. BLOCKINT provides national security analysts and officials with unique data on how a threat actor is using virtual assets for revenue generation. It also provides a high-level overview of a country's cryptocurrency usage, which could provide valuable insights into the nation’s overall economic health and strategy. The importance of blockchain analysis was underscored in 2024 when the US Senate Committee on Armed Services recommended that the Department of Defense (DOD) explore blockchain technology to potentially revolutionize national security. In the committee’s 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), they instructed the Secretary of Defense to investigate and test potential blockchain applications for DoD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Department of Defense has made clear, commercial solutions for trend analysis, finding anomalies, and providing data for decision makers are abundant. The intelligence community already has some of these abilities. What is missing is the fusion of this data into one picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting with Cultural Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to provide the intelligence needed for an increasingly complex world, we need to fundamentally change the practice of intelligence to accept the importance of publicly available and commercially available data. Additionally, the intelligence cycle needs to change. The intelligence cycle needs to start with open source information and data. This means that the intelligence community also needs to incorporate the technology and the algorithms that will allow today’s intelligence professionals see trends, anomalies, and threats in that data. This data then should be fused with intelligence collected by the traditional intelligence disciplines to provide decisionmakers and operators with the information they need to perform their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, to demonstrate the importance of harnessing the publicly and commercially available data, the intelligence community must develop an open source center that brings in the myriad open source/PAI/CAI and data sifting technologies that industry currently is building. The high tech center would be the first step for intelligence analysts of all types in building threat and warning analysis and targeting. This center would be a place where the US and its allies could share data and techniques to build a global warning picture. It would be the intelligence community’s beginning of the Enterprise Command and Control picture or the Common Intelligence Picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will need creativity and leadership to move forward with this generational change in how the intelligence community does business. If this major shake up does not begin soon, the US will lose its edge and remarkable, intelligence driven operations like Absolute Resolve will become amazing stories of American glory that we recount to our grandchildren. The change can happen now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

As Thomas Mann argued in the early 20th century, authoritarians gain power because they activate dispositions that already exist within democratic societies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2025, sovereign-debt sustainability was largely a matter of luck. In 2026, governments and creditors must embrace a new framework for action on debt –&amp;nbsp;one that identifies and addresses hidden debt issues before they spiral out of control, and delivers restructuring agreements fast enough to offer genuine relief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Kremlin Files: Russian Double Agents and Operational Games</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-kremlin-files-russian-double-agents-and-operational-games</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/the-kgb-id-card-of-british-double-agent-kim-philby-is-displayed-at-the-exhibition-90-years-of-russia-s-foreign-intelligence-serv.jpg?id=63831073&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=95%2C0%2C95%2C0&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE KREMLIN FILES / COLUMN &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;There are similarities among intelligence agencies worldwide. All professional services rely on tradecraft to recruit and manage assets. They all operate within bureaucratic systems and ultimately answer to political leaders. At a basic level, espionage tradecraft is a common professional language. However, Russian intelligence services (RIS) differ significantly from their Western counterparts in several key aspects. First, their primary mission is not to serve the interests of the Russian people, nor to protect the country's constitution; instead, their loyalty is to the regime and Putin’s personal political survival. And secondly, in terms of tradecraft, they differ from the CIA and other Western services in their approach and tactics. One of the most important—and often misunderstood—aspects of Russian intelligence is their use of double agents, known in Russian intelligence doctrine as operational games (&lt;em&gt;operativnye igry&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Russian intelligence, operational games are not just niche skills or occasional counterintelligence tactics. They are fundamental. Double agent operations are central to how Russian agencies define success, justify their importance, and maintain their institutional identity. Whether other collection methods succeed or fail, the RIS reliably and continually default back to operational games. Therefore, understanding how and why the RIS use double agents is essential to understanding Russian intelligence itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before examining how these operations work, it is important to get the terminology right, and something that even experienced national security reporters, espionage writers, and analysts in the West frequently get wrong. The term &lt;em&gt;double agent&lt;/em&gt; is often misapplied to describe penetrations of one intelligence service by another. In reality, these are two very different phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A penetration is an agent who betrays their own service to spy for a foreign power. Aldrich Ames, who recently passed away three decades after he was arrested, was a traitor and a penetration of the CIA by Russian intelligence. He was not a double agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A double agent, by contrast, is an intelligence asset who is knowingly and deliberately directed by one service to engage another in espionage. The controlling service uses that agent to feed information (called feed material) —true, false, or mixed—to the adversary. They do so to simultaneously study the adversary’s tradecraft, collection priorities, and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Russian system, double agents also serve a bureaucratic function: they generate statistics, “success stories,” and operational narratives that demonstrate effectiveness to political overseers and ultimately to Putin himself. Putin knows this; after all, he was a Lieutenant Colonel in the KGB Second Chief Directorate (responsible for Counterintelligence for the USSR), and he later headed the FSB himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

The distinction is not academic. It lies at the heart of how Russian intelligence thinks about espionage. Every year, the FSB publishes an annual report and claims statistics on hundreds of alleged spies it has caught. The vast majority of them are invented, manufactured, or the FSB’s own double agents. In other words, they are not &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian services employ multiple varieties of double agents and operational games. They have many names, including the &lt;em&gt;initsiativnik&lt;/em&gt;, which is a false volunteer who often “walks in” to an embassy. Also used is the &lt;em&gt;podstava&lt;/em&gt;, or dangle, in which Russian services will use the routine of an intelligence officer, diplomat, or journalist and insert the “dangle” right in front of the target at a gym, reception, or other function to appeal to the target. There are still more different varieties and names for other types of double agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These operations are not limited to targeting foreign intelligence services. They are also used against businesspeople, journalists, diplomats, nongovernmental organizations, and even Russian citizens themselves. The objective is often not solely intelligence collection, but also control, as the Russians say, to have the target “&lt;em&gt;pod kontrolem&lt;/em&gt;,” or under 100% operational control and influence. That is why the Russians prefer, though not exclusively, to carry out double agent operations on Russian soil. Abroad, they are less confident that the SVR or GRU can fully control their double agent during meetings with the adversary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end goal is to ensnare, compromise, manipulate, arrest, or extort targets for recruitment and long-term exploitation. A few examples from history help illustrate Russian intelligence’s fixation on double agents, dating back to its earliest institutional roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cheka and later the NKVD/OGPU perfected operational games in the 1920s through landmark deceptions such as Operation TRUST. With the TRUST operation, the OGPU (Soviet counterintelligence at the time, another forerunner of the KGB) created a fictitious anti-Bolshevik underground to lure in Western intelligence services and Russian émigrés. TRUST sent intelligence officers to the West, or cooptees, who they intimidated to pose as members of this fake organization that claimed to stand against the Bolsheviks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operation ran for years, successfully feeding disinformation to multiple foreign services while identifying, neutralizing, or recruiting their agents. They often lured Russians home to “help in operations” only to have them arrested, interrogated, and usually shot in the back of the head in a Chekist-style &lt;em&gt;vyshama mera&lt;/em&gt; (highest measure) execution. The TRUST culminated in the capture of the famous British intelligence officer Sidney Reilly, one of the most celebrated spies of the era, who was executed in a similar fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That double-agent tradition continued throughout the Cold War, when Soviet intelligence used double agents not merely to mislead adversaries but also to validate its own competence. Kim Philby, while often remembered in the West as a Soviet penetration of British intelligence, was also used as part of broader operational games to shape Western threat perceptions and protect other Soviet assets. Scores of Western intelligence officers or special operations team members were wrapped up in the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe immediately after World War II, the victims of KGB and OGPU/GRU operational games Philby had detailed to the USSR. Most were eventually executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later decades, the KGB ran controlled double agents against Western services to exaggerate Soviet capabilities, mask vulnerabilities, and manipulate counterintelligence priorities. The Soviet KGB ran a wave of double-agents at the CIA in the late 1980s with false feed material to explain the 1985 U.S. intelligence losses. Rick Ames volunteered and compromised a dozen agents working for the CIA and FBI (Ames was not arrested till 1994). The KGB and later SVR used these operational games and false volunteers to protect him, trying to give CIA and the broader U.S. IC reasons why the compromise may have happened (&lt;em&gt;Circle of Treason &lt;/em&gt;is a classic read on this period and all the various games the KGB was playing to protect Ames with false feeds to CIA and the FBI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These operations reinforced an internal belief that intelligence success could be measured by how convincingly one could influence the enemy’s perception of reality. In Russian intelligence culture, the double agent is not an exception — it is the ideal. In today’s FSB, however, as well as their foreign counterparts, the SVR, the double agent too often is used to justify their very own existence, instead of paying dividends in terms of tradecraft learned or secrets protected. Operations like TRUST are mostly a relic of the past. Today, the FSB is too busy entrapping innocent foreigners like basketball players, teachers, and NGO workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. IC and our Western allies have learned over the decades that the FSB/SVR and GRU have presented double-agent cases to their political leadership as if they were genuine agents caught and arrested, all the while the case was simply that they were double agents. They feed statistics from the FSB each year about exaggerated intelligence operations—more than all the services in the world could carry out against Russia—and also claim to have thwarted all of them. These reports reach Putin and the Presidential Administration to justify larger budgets, which in turn breed more corruption and line the pockets of senior and middle managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not unique to Russia; it is often the case across the former Soviet countries of Central Asia, where many of the services remain close and subservient to the Russian FSB and SVR. These services, often serving despotic regimes, swear by double agent operations because, in many cases and over many years, the only “spies” they can really uncover are those they falsely created under a double agent operation. They use them against a range of unwitting foreign citizens, including in legitimate business practices, to extort them and their companies for money when brought up on false charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice has been expanded in recent years by the Russian FSB, particularly its counterintelligence division, DKRO (the Department of Counterintelligence Operations), which uses double agents against journalists, businesspeople, and others to trap them and hold them hostage for exchanges with the West. DKRO was responsible for the false arrest and imprisonment of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich before his 2024 swap with the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sum, operational games and the double agents associated with them allow Russian intelligence to shape narratives, manufacture threats, and create the appearance of omnipresence. They are dirty tricks elevated to doctrine. And they remain one of Moscow’s most effective tools for compensating for broader institutional weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the US Government.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since intervening in Venezuela, US President Donald Trump has escalated his threats to use direct military action against Mexico’s drug cartels. But this would be ineffective, because curbing the cartels' power requires exposing their connections to the ruling Morena party.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump seems to think that he can impose high tariffs on other economies, such as China, without facing retaliation, thereby securing huge gains for the US. But as game theory – in particular, the prisoner's dilemma – shows, the more likely outcome is that both sides will end up worse off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>EU Takes Aim at Tehran: IRGC Terror Listing Opens New Front in Europe’s Iran Policy</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/eu-takes-aim-at-tehran-irgc-terror-listing-opens-new-front-in-europes-iran-policy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;On January 29, Europe found its voice against Iran’s apparatus of terror. The European Union (EU) announced that it is adding Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) to its list of designated terrorist entities. The EU spent years mulling this step and taking half measures. Now, the EU and its member states must use this new much-needed tool broadly and effectively. The EU’s designation should mark the start of Europe’s campaign against the IRGC, not its end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formally listing the IRGC will give Europe important new authorities to limit Iranian attacks and plotting on their soil. The EU’s move also has major symbolic value, particularly at a time when the Iranian regime is under pressure at home and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU previously sanctioned some of the IRGC’s branches, leaders, and operatives. But EU member states resisted taking action against the IRGC in its entirety for several reasons, including European fears of Tehran’s reaction. Iran has long been vocal in its opposition to an IRGC designation, warning in recent days that an EU label would have “destructive consequences.” The U.S. unwillingness to lift its own Foreign Terrorist Organization listing of the IRGC was reportedly a key reason why U.S.-Iran negotiations fell apart during the Biden administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU designation comes on the heels of the Iranian regime’s bloody crackdown against its own outraged people. The EU’s decision—reached by consensus among its 27 member states—lends Europe’s united voice to the Iranian protestors’ indignation against their oppressors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU action also sends a powerful message to Tehran that it should refrain from conducting attacks on European soil against its perceived enemies, particularly Iranian dissidents and Israeli and Jewish targets. European security officials express great concern about that risk now. Both the IRGC’s deadly Quds Force and Iran’s notorious Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) have conducted numerous terrorist plots in recent years in Europe, including in Sweden, Germany, Cyprus, and Belgium. Individual European governments have disrupted and prosecuted these networks and issued statements condemning Iranian behavior, but this is the most unified and strongest European stance to date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the EU designation, any IRGC assets in Europe are now subject to an asset freeze. It is now illegal to provide the group with funds or resources. The designation also requires EU member states to increase police and judicial cooperation on IRGC-related criminal matters. And the EU will impose a travel ban on IRGC members hoping to visit Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Europeans should now aim to use these tools vigorously. The IRGC has historically had near global reach, not only with its terrorist cells but with its procurement and financial networks. Uncovering and disrupting the IRGC’s networks and freezing their assets would weaken the corps’ capabilities to rearm, profit, and funnel materiel and finances to its proxies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe can and should do much more to maximize the impact of the designation and impose real costs on the IRGC and its overlords. The EU’s 2013 designation of Hezbollah’s so-called “military wing” offers a good model for how an EU designation can empower both the EU and its member states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the EU should ensure that Europol – the EU’s umbrella police agency – gets a key role in coordinating and supporting IRGC-related investigations across Europe, as Europol has done with Hezbollah. Before the EU’s designation, Europol’s ability to police the IRGC’s operatives in Europe was greatly limited. The IRGC’s many European plots often have a consistent modus operandi, including using criminal actors not associated with Iran to carry out attacks and thus offer Tehran a figleaf of deniability. Europol is uniquely positioned to see the whole picture and share relevant information with all EU member states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one model, look to Europol’s involvement in the complex multi-jurisdictional investigation of the Hezbollah financier Mohamad Nourredine, which involved multiple European governments as well as several U.S. law enforcement agencies. In 2018, he was convicted in a French court on multiple charges and sentenced to seven years in prison as part of a multi-country investigation codenamed “Operation Cedar.” Europol could use provide similar support in international investigations against IRGC operatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, Europol has also played an integral role, along with the United States, in the Law Enforcement Coordination Group, the sole international body dedicated to countering Hezbollah’s terrorist and illicit activity. The EU should empower Europol to do likewise for the U.S.-led Countering Transnational Terrorism Forum, which focuses on Iran-linked terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, European governments must follow up on the EU’s actions and impose their own national bans and designations. Many European countries did just this against Hezbollah, including Germany, Slovenia, Austria, the United Kingdom, and the Baltics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take Germany, which shows how national-level actions can strengthen law enforcement and build on Brussels’s actions. In May 2020, Germany formally banned Hezbollah and conducted near simultaneous raids on several Hezbollah-linked organizations in the country. Germany is now prosecuting a Lebanese national allegedly tied to Hezbollah for procuring drone components for the terrorist group – a scheme that also took place in the U.K. and Spain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU’s IRGC designation won’t tip the balance of power within Iran in favor of the protestors, but it can still help reduce Iran’s ability to stage vicious attacks abroad. The EU and its member states must robustly implement these new authorities for them to have the desperately needed effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael Jacobson, a senior fellow in The Washington Institute’s Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, formerly served as director of strategy, plans, and initiatives in the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rather than address the weaknesses of the grant-based approach to global health financing, donors want to scrap it in favor of instruments that mobilize more private capital. But this new architecture distorts the risk landscape in ways that socialize losses, while privatizing profits and control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Should Western Tech Giants Partner With Pro-Hamas Network Al Jazeera?</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/should-western-tech-giants-partner-with-pro-hamas-network-al-jazeera</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;A few weeks ago, Al Jazeera &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2025-12-21-Al-Jazeera-Media-Network-Launches-The-Core,-an-AI-Integrated-News-Model-Built-on-Google-Cloud&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2025-12-21-Al-Jazeera-Media-Network-Launches-The-Core,-an-AI-Integrated-News-Model-Built-on-Google-Cloud&quot;&gt;named&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Google Cloud as its primary technology provider for “The Core,” a sweeping program designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence (AI) throughout its production process. The move, which further deepened the relationship between the two companies, should sound alarm bells for policymakers and anyone concerned with the accuracy, credibility, and transparency of the news media and information space, which impacts nearly every aspect of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Core enables more efficient reporting and even drafts scripts that humans generally would otherwise write. Reporters can pull archival material in seconds, generate compelling data visualizations — visual stories — and synthetic images at planetary scale, and automate story planning, all through AI platforms built by Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s not the innovation that’s the problem but rather its use to generate and amplify adversarial state-funded and directed news with no warning labels to its global audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Qatari state &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://empowr.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2020-09-14-DOJ-Jay-Bratt-to-DLA-Piper-Al-Jazeera-FARA-Registration.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://empowr.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2020-09-14-DOJ-Jay-Bratt-to-DLA-Piper-Al-Jazeera-FARA-Registration.pdf&quot;&gt;funds and oversees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Al Jazeera, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://empowr.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2020-09-14-DOJ-Jay-Bratt-to-DLA-Piper-Al-Jazeera-FARA-Registration.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://empowr.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2020-09-14-DOJ-Jay-Bratt-to-DLA-Piper-Al-Jazeera-FARA-Registration.pdf&quot;&gt;shaping editorial output&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Because of its shared ideology with the Muslim Brotherhood, Al Jazeera’s content often reflects the lens of the Muslim Brotherhood, three branches of which the United States just &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/01/terrorist-designations-of-muslim-brotherhood-chapters&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/01/terrorist-designations-of-muslim-brotherhood-chapters&quot;&gt;designated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; as a terrorist organization. The Qatari outlet also has a &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-787220&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-787220&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; of producing content that glorifies terrorism. Tech companies that help Al Jazeera amplify its content using algorithms, AI, or other methods, advance Qatari foreign policy rather than reflecting independent media assessments on a wide range of worldviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the Al Jazeera-Google program is “AJ-LLM,” described as the editorial brain of the system that will be trained on Al Jazeera’s archives and connected to Gemini Enterprise, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadcastprome.com/news/al-jazeera-launches-the-core-ai-news-model-on-google-cloud/#:~:text=At%20the%20centre%20of%20the,trends%20and%20develop%20predictive%20dashboards.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.broadcastprome.com/news/al-jazeera-launches-the-core-ai-news-model-on-google-cloud/#:~:text=At%20the%20centre%20of%20the,trends%20and%20develop%20predictive%20dashboards.&quot;&gt;according&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; to the companies. Al Jazeera is already very prominently cited in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude in questions about the Gaza war, and Gemini could very well follow that trajectory with this expanded partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While one reason Al Jazeera features prominently in LLM answers is because it has no paywall. New partnerships, including Google’s major expansion with Al Jazeera, may fuel its presence even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al Jazeera &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadcastprome.com/news/al-jazeera-launches-the-core-ai-news-model-on-google-cloud/#:~:text=At%20the%20centre%20of%20the,trends%20and%20develop%20predictive%20dashboards.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.broadcastprome.com/news/al-jazeera-launches-the-core-ai-news-model-on-google-cloud/#:~:text=At%20the%20centre%20of%20the,trends%20and%20develop%20predictive%20dashboards.&quot;&gt;assures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; there will be sufficient human oversight in the process. However, Al Jazeera’s current and historic content, with its anti-Western bias that amplifies the likes of Hamas, loaded into its LLM platform, will churn out faster, flashier versions of the same editorial product, in countless formats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today.

Because these AI systems operate as black boxes with limited transparency, audiences may receive &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://simonerodan.substack.com/p/how-al-jazeera-built-a-media-machine?utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://simonerodan.substack.com/p/how-al-jazeera-built-a-media-machine?utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true&quot;&gt;algorithmically amplified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; narratives that systematically favor Hamas and Muslim Brotherhood perspectives while appearing to be the product of neutral technological systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, Google &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gco.gov.qa/en/media-centre/top-news/gco-partners-with-google-news-initiative-and-al-jazeera-media-institute-to-deliver-media-training/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.gco.gov.qa/en/media-centre/top-news/gco-partners-with-google-news-initiative-and-al-jazeera-media-institute-to-deliver-media-training/&quot;&gt;partnered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; with the Qatari Government Communications Office and the Al Jazeera Media Institute to train journalists in building digital-focused newsrooms. Participants included news directors, journalists, and representatives from various media organizations across Qatar’s media landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of messages do Al Jazeera trainers convey to journalists and diplomats who take their courses? The case of Muhammed Khamaiseh from the Al Jazeera Media Institute is instructive. In 2018, Khamaiseh &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/F2MuB&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://archive.is/F2MuB&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, “Jews have been known for centuries to be cunning thinkers, and currently, the entire global economic system is under their control.” Khamaiseh had previously celebrated Hamas rocket attacks on Israeli civilians in 2014 and offered affection for Hamas after its kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers. “This is why we love Hamas :D,” he &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jns.org/journalism-of-jihad/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.jns.org/journalism-of-jihad/&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Ironically, Khamaiseh is the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://institute.aljazeera.net/sites/default/files/2019/Avoid-Discrimination-HateSpeech-Media.pdf?title=Avoiding%20Discrimination%20and%20Hate%20Speech%20in%20Media&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://institute.aljazeera.net/sites/default/files/2019/Avoid-Discrimination-HateSpeech-Media.pdf?title=Avoiding%20Discrimination%20and%20Hate%20Speech%20in%20Media&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; of “A Guide Avoiding Discrimination and Hate Speech in the Media, published by the Al Jazeera Media Institute.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qatar is an authoritarian nation, whose &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/01/qatar-repressive-new-law-further-curbs-freedom-of-expression/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/01/qatar-repressive-new-law-further-curbs-freedom-of-expression/&quot;&gt;stringent media laws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; prohibit any criticism of Qatari leadership or policy, making Al Jazeera’s output anything but independent. The Department of Justice has &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://empowr.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2020-09-14-DOJ-Jay-Bratt-to-DLA-Piper-Al-Jazeera-FARA-Registration.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://empowr.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2020-09-14-DOJ-Jay-Bratt-to-DLA-Piper-Al-Jazeera-FARA-Registration.pdf&quot;&gt;determined&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; that Al Jazeera is owned and directed by a foreign government. Congress has asked Justice to review whether the Qatari government should be required to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. DOJ has already required Al Jazeera’s AJ+ to register but the Qatari network has failed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq are among the countries that have placed bans on Al Jazeera. Some bans remain on the Qatari channel. In addition, despite Al Jazeera posing as a savior of Palestinians, prominent Palestinians have long expressed &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/afalkhatib/status/1987233366094323944&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://x.com/afalkhatib/status/1987233366094323944&quot;&gt;concerns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; that Al Jazeera has stirred up regional hostilities and fomented violence, a problem that would be amplified if Al Jazeera’s cleverly designed content is recast as neutral algorithmic outputs. News consumers would be hard-pressed to find examples of Al Jazeera criticizing Hamas’s atrocities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators should regard AI partnerships with foreign state-directed authoritarian media as they would regard sensitive technologies. They should trigger formal risk assessments. Congress should require companies with AI products to disclose the extent to which foreign state-directed media sources are used in training data, retrieval systems, or generated outputs. Absent such transparency, lawmakers and the public cannot evaluate the scale of foreign state influence embedded in AI-driven information systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google should also require clear labeling when AI-generated news summaries or analytical outputs rely on content from foreign state-directed media organizations. Users should not be left to assume neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing Americans and the global community from being manipulated by the Qatari state’s anti-Western, pro-extremist Al Jazeera content, even though it may be cloaked in high-tech flash, should be a top priority for both technology companies and policymakers. It’s time to pull back the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fdd-new.cmail19.com/t/r-l-tkdrnht-niytiidujr-ir/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://fdd-new.cmail19.com/t/r-l-tkdrnht-niytiidujr-ir/&quot;&gt;Toby Dershowitz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; is a senior advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, where Asher Boiskin is an intern.

      <title>Inside the $35 Billion Plan to Track Hypersonic Missiles from Space</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/inside-the-35-billion-plan-to-track-hypersonic-missiles-from-space</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION —&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The Department of Defense’s Space Development Agency (SDA) is developing a new space-based architecture comprised of a large constellation of at least 300-500 satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) to detect and track potential missile threats. This system will complement other space systems currently providing this capability. SDA is developing this new system in part in response to peer and near-peer competitors that are designing strategic and tactical hypersonic weapons that are not easily detected, identified, or tracked by current space-based missile warning systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a quote from a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report sent to Congress last Wednesday entitled &lt;em&gt;MISSILE WARNING SATELLITES, Space Development Agency Should &lt;/em&gt;Be&lt;em&gt; More Realistic and Transparent About Risks to Capability Delivery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve chosen to write about this report because it contains not only the best description of how complicated and costly just one aspect of missile defense has become, but also it provides the most understandable history of what’s been done up to now, along with the threats we face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known within the Defense Department (DoD) as the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) – and started in 2020 -- the plan, according to the GAO report, is “intended to provide space surveillance and communications for persistent, timely, global awareness [of missile threats] that is designed to operate in an increasingly contested space environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DoD so far has committed nearly $11 billion to this effort, which is programmed to cost near $35 billion through fiscal year 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the PWSA deals with tracking an already launched missile and its warhead, there are two other elements of a missile warning system: Detecting the launch and communicating information within elements of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, missile threats have been detected and tracked because they are launched using powerful rocket boosters which produce heat and light making them easy to initially see and follow and predict their ballistic trajectories. Infrared sensors on space satellites can detect heat from launched missiles and booster plumes against Earth’s background&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1970, DoD put in place the first Defense Support Program satellites, which used infrared sensors. These first satellites with infrared sensors, and the infrared systems that have followed, have operated from geosynchronous Earth orbits (GEO), which allow those satellites to stay fixed over a single, longitudinal spot located about 22,000 miles above Earth. This results in each GEO satellite maintaining constant observation of a specific area of the globe and collectively monitoring the entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1990s, DoD developed the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) to replace and provide significantly more robust data than the Defense Support Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday’s GAO report said, “In recent years, DoD has identified emerging threats that these [SBIRS] systems may be unable to effectively warn or defend against. For example, Russia and China have successfully demonstrated hypersonic missile capabilities. In addition to new missile threats posed by potential adversaries, DoD has also publicly acknowledged emerging threats to our space assets. For example, DoD reported that China is developing additional counterspace capabilities including directed energy weapons, electronic warfare, and other anti-satellite weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the GAO, “U.S. missile warning satellites currently operating in GEO may be particularly vulnerable to these emerging threats because there are relatively few of them -- making them high-value targets -- and their location above Earth is effectively stationary and predictable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately three DSP satellites of the original 23 DSP system remain in orbit with one maybe still operational. In addition, beginning in 2011 there have been six SBIR satellites put in orbit and SBIRS sensors placed on four additional host satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GAO report said, “SBIRS will soon be followed by the Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) system, designed as an upgraded replacement for SBIRS, with sensors that are expected to have even greater sensitivity than current SBIRS sensors. While providing some enhanced capabilities, such as greater sensitivity, the Next Gen OPIR system is built around an architecture similar to existing systems now in GEO orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DoD is also developing space-based laser communications technology to support large constellations of satellites for missions, including missile warning and data transport. However, a February 2025 GAO report found that DoD had “made progress in developing this technology, but it also faced delays and other issues -- and hasn't fully demonstrated that it works in space. Despite these challenges, DOD plans to continue to develop and launch hundreds of satellites worth billions of dollars that require the use of laser communications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DoD’s plan for the new PWSA missile satellites in LEO, internally referred to as the Tracking Layer, will complement the Next Gen OPIR satellites for what is termed missile warning/missile tracking (MW/MT) functions, and will use laser technology to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because satellites in LEO are much closer to Earth than those in GEO, many more satellites are needed in a LEO-based constellation to achieve the same coverage as a single one in GEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The missile tracking satellites in LEO are traveling much faster relative to Earth’s surface and therefore each satellite can only observe a small section of Earth’s surface for a short time -- only about 10 minutes. This makes constellation development more complicated if constant global coverage is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some DoD officials say having a greater number of satellites performing MW/MT in LEO will result in greater resiliency for the constellation as a whole and the capability it provides,” the GAO report says, adding, “For example, if one satellite in a proliferated constellation is damaged -- whether intentionally or by natural environmental effects -- the constellation’s capability is degraded by a smaller margin than if the entire constellation was made up of only a handful of satellites.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current plan has been to develop a large constellation of tracking satellites in LEO, along with data transport layer satellites forming a communications network to provide mission data directly that will enable advanced missile tracking from LEO to ground stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tracking satellite, according to the GAO report, is “comprised of a spacecraft – referred to as a bus -- plus other components such as infrared sensors, on-board mission data processors, and communication payloads, together with a ground segment to manage the constellation and receive and process track data to send to the wider DoD and intelligence community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be some 600 satellites in all, with plans then to replenish each tranche every two years in perpetuity, along with associated ground systems, according to the GAO report. As the LEO-orbiting tracking satellites approach the end of their life, “SDA will deorbit them,” the report says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SDA has been acquiring tranches of both tracking and data transport layer satellites beginning with a demonstration tranche, called Tranche 0 (T0) that was launched in April 2023. Of the 27 satellites in T0, 19 performed data transport and communications, while eight did missile warning. One additional satellite remained on the ground as a test bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tranche 0 was designed to be a “warfighter immersion” tranche, giving service members the opportunity to work with the systems, understand their capabilities, and to develop operational concepts for their use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An SDA official told the GAO T0 demonstrated “the ability to track a short-range ballistic missile throughout its flight and into its terminal phase and then transmit raw data to the ground from space.” It also connected the tactical data link network used by NATO, from space to specific ships and military airplanes and established the first satellite-to-satellite demonstration of optical links between two of the four T0 contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2025, Tranche 1 of the PWSA program, put 21 tracking satellites into orbit, followed the next month by another 21 data transport layer satellites. Overall, Tranche 1 is scheduled to consist of 128 satellites for the Transport Layer and 26 for the Tracking Layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SDA said back in October 2025, “Beginning in 2027, T1 will provide an initial warfighting capability through the PWSA to deliver regional persistence for tactical military data channels…along with advanced missile tracking and missile warning, and beyond-line-of-sight targeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday’s GAO report said, “According to SDA, T1 will establish the PWSA ground and operations baseline, or the foundation upon which SDA plans to add capabilities in future tranches. To reduce risk, SDA is taking an incremental approach to delivering these ground operations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the next T1 satellite launches have been delayed to sometime this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday’s GAO report raised significant issues in the ongoing PWSA program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, it said, “SDA had planned to allow the warfighter to provide feedback on capabilities prior to a larger SDA investment in T1 and future tranches, but officials from combatant commands we spoke to told us that they have not been asked to provide feedback on T0 MW/MT demonstrations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a broader sense, the GAO said, “SDA has not taken steps to understand the range of risks to delivering MW/MT capabilities by assessing the technological maturity -- such as by conducting a technology readiness assessment -- of critical technology elements included in its satellite development given required modifications and use in new environments. Absent such assessments, SDA remains overly reliant on technology maturity estimates provided by contractors and lacks key insights to better develop realistic development timelines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, as with many needed highly-technical and complex defense systems, this new space-based, large constellation of satellites in low Earth orbit to detect and track potential missile threats appears to be developing higher costs and a delay before it is fully operational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every &quot;logical&quot; explanation that has been applied to US President Donald Trump's unhinged behavior over the years has proven inadequate. At this point, detractors and former supporters alike are recognizing that Trump's words and deeds can be explained by only one thing: mental derangement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Technological leadership is often framed as a matter of singular breakthroughs rather than institutional capacity. But the rapid development of penicillin during World War II shows that coordinated public leadership, strong research institutions, and a dynamic private sector produce results no other innovation system can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The U.S.-China Economic Cold War Is No Longer Silent</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/us-china-economic-cold-war</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION —&lt;/strong&gt; For decades&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the United States (U.S.) operated under a fatal delusion that free trade with China would liberalize its politics and that the global market was a neutral playing field. We were profoundly wrong. In 2000&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the U.S. controlled 37% of global semiconductor fabrication. Today&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; we control less than 12%&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; while China is on track for 40% by 2030. While we played by the rules of Adam Smith&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; Beijing played by the rules of Sun Tzu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now in the midst of a silent asymmetric economic war. China does not have a private sector in the American sense. Under its strategy of Civil Military Fusion&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; every ByteDance algorithm and every ton of refined lithium is a dual use asset of the Chinese Communist Party. Meanwhile&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the U.S. encouraged the atrophy of its industrial base by prioritizing short term profits from outsourcing to China instead of securing our own economic and national security future. The West created this irrational strategic vulnerability where Beijing now controls 80% of refined rare earth supplies and more than 60% of the magnets in actuation systems for the F35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that economic security is national security&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the Trump administration has installed a genuine war cabinet for economic conflict. This includes the Treasury and Commerce Secretaries&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; but the pivot is most visible at the Department of War. There the Deputy Secretary, is a battle&lt;u&gt;-&lt;/u&gt; tested private equity leader who left his firm in order to bring his skills to fight and has operationalized a new offensive strategy to link private sector dynamism with state imperatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It’s never been more important to understand what’s happening in the world. Upgrade your access to exclusive content by &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;becoming a subscriber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tip of this spear is the newly chartered Economic Defense Unit or EDU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directly overseen by the Deputy Secretary of War and run by another private equity industry specialist in industrial consolidation, the EDU is not another regulator. It functions as an internal merchant bank designed to bypass the Pentagon’s notoriously slow procurement cycles. The EDU has replaced compliance&lt;u&gt;-&lt;/u&gt; based bureaucracy with commercial first financing. Its mandate is to generate investable demand signals using the government balance sheet to de-risk private capital investment in the defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of vague promises&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the EDU now utilizes Advance Market Commitments. These are binding contracts to purchase critical technologies such as solid rocket motors or autonomous drones before the factories are even built. This transforms government contracts into bankable assets that companies can use to secure private loans. Furthermore&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the EDU has restructured acquisition management&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; replacing narrow Program Executive Officers with Portfolio Acquisition Executives who are authorized to move capital rapidly across capability sets much like a private equity managing partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complementing this is the transformed Office of Strategic Capital or OSC. Once merely an advisory body&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the OSC has been re codified by the FY2026 NDAA into a direct capital allocator. It is aggressively bridging the valley of death not just for software but for heavy manufacturing. By offering direct loans and guarantees specifically for equipment finance&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; the OSC ensures that American companies can afford the high capital machinery needed to onshore production of semiconductors and batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This architecture represents a total departure from the status quo. We are moving from a system that audits costs to a system that finances outcomes. The Army parallel initiative to grant Direct Commissions to Silicon Valley engineers further reinforces this culture shift – destroying the wall between the Pentagon and Palo Alto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message to the American private sector is clear. The era of neutrality is over. There is no free market left to win if China ends up owning the building blocks of every major industry. Wall Street and Silicon Valley must partner with the USG not out of charity&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; but out of necessity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration has built the financial and policy architecture for economic sovereignty. American capital now faces the simplest decision in its history, which is to deploy here and own the 21st century&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; or deploy elsewhere and become its tenant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Latin American and Caribbean region has weathered the increase in US import tariffs relatively well, although certain countries and sectors have been more affected than others. But the more fraught global trade environment has underscored the need to deepen ties with regional and extra-regional partners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Greenland’s Worth a Fight and Russia’s Trying to Start One</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/greenlands-worth-a-fight-and-russias-trying-to-start-one</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT PERSPECTIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;The “quickest way for Russia to penetrate our naval defenses is steaming from the Arctic to the North Atlantic.” The Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) Gap is the last place allied forces “have any hope of detecting a Russian sub before it’s in the vast Atlantic barreling toward New York.” These insightful comments were spoken not by President Donald Trump but by &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/__0Qubv3Dn8?si=bkhDFuCxgHg63TXE&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fictional President Grace Penn&lt;/a&gt; in Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;The Diplomat&lt;/em&gt;. By contrast Trump’s rhetoric and attempts to gain leverage on Denmark have been appalling and unhelpful. But Trump and “President Penn” are both right about one thing — although the Arctic island is remote, Greenland’s location makes it fundamental to U.S. and NATO naval intelligence and missile defense missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia knows this as well and is using the Trump-inspired kerfuffle to &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/russia-watches-us-european-tensions-greenland-glee-gloating-129427398&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drive a disinformation narrative&lt;/a&gt; intended to further weaken Euro-Atlantic relations. Kremlin-aligned sources have been circulating social media posts suggesting that Western aid to Ukraine has weakened European countries and that weaponry committed to Kyiv may be redistributed to Greenland. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsguardrealitycheck.com/p/russian-fakes-make-the-most-of-europes#:~:text=Actually%3A%20The,Kremlin%20bot%20activity.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deepfake&lt;/a&gt; of a Danish newscaster stating that Denmark plans to recall all F-16s given to Ukraine to be redeployed to Greenland was circulated by Russian influence accounts and received over 45.3K &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghostarchive.org/archive/e7tU3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;views&lt;/a&gt; on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsguardrealitycheck.com/p/russian-fakes-make-the-most-of-europes#:~:text=Another%20video%20imitated,sent%20via%20email.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, which received over 254.3K &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghostarchive.org/archive/UBxYr&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;views&lt;/a&gt; on X, imitated the Institute for the Study of War and claimed that Europeans siding with Ukraine in 2022 is costing them Greenland now and that NATO will be destroyed soon, thereby forcing Europeans to align with Moscow. This Russian &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscriber.politicopro.com/newsletter/2026/01/trumps-greenland-play-is-fueling-russian-disinfo-campaigns-00581185#:~:text=FUEL%20ON%20THE,Russia%2DUkraine%20war.%E2%80%9D&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tactic&lt;/a&gt; of riffing off legitimate think tanks and news channels to validate Russian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/09/26/how-u-s-adversaries-undermine-the-perception-of-election-integrity/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lies&lt;/a&gt; is essential to making their false pro-Kremlin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/10/29/foreign-malign-election-meddling-persists-but-struggles-to-gain-traction/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;narratives&lt;/a&gt; appear more credible and increase the likelihood of their posts spreading across social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow is trying to use the divide between the United States and Europe to sow confusion, degrade support for Ukraine, and rupture NATO. What Putin forgets is that disagreements between allies are common and constructively overcoming them builds stronger relationships. The strategic importance of Greenland demands the alliance work through its disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are significant reasons why Russia is trying so hard to split NATO over Greenland. Nuuk holds significant naval intelligence value. Moscow’s Northern Fleet and nuclear submarine HQ are on the Kola Peninsula, located near the Russia-Finland border. For Russian (RU) forces to reach the North and Baltic Seas, and beyond into the North Atlantic Ocean, RU submarines must transit through the GIUK Gap; making the two stretches of water critical for monitoring RU subsea activity, just as “President Penn” demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2025/7/16/just-in-china-russia-arctic-allyship-appears-to-grow-but-distrust-presents-roadblocks-report-says&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; between Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic and China’s increasing interest in the region over the past decade should raise red flags for NATO. In 2018, China released their first Arctic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2018/620231/EPRS_BRI(2018)620231_EN.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt;, in which they called themselves a “near-Arctic state” and detailed a desire to establish a “polar silk road.” Since then, China and Russia have performed numerous joint air and naval patrols in Arctic waters. Coordination between U.S. adversaries in the High North places an even higher value on NATO Arctic maritime intelligence capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenland is also strategically important for missile defense operations. Nuuk is a prime location for American early warning systems to track intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with trajectories that arch over the High North. The Pentagon currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://simpleflying.com/us-air-force-base-greenland-strategic-role/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;operates&lt;/a&gt; a variety of early warning radars and communications systems at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland. These radars work in tandem with systems in Alaska and Canada to provide essential early warning capabilities for U.S. missile defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICBMs launched by Moscow can reach the United States in approximately 40 &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2026/01/20/us-news/greenland-critical-for-us-to-fend-off-icmbs-from-russia-and-beyond-experts/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMost%20Americans%20are,in%20the%20US&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;minutes&lt;/a&gt;, offering the Pentagon’s command and control centers, and the president himself, extremely limited time to detect, decide, and respond. This mission set will expand as Russia develops long-range conventional hypersonic missiles that will also use a High North flight route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing and expanding U.S. military radar and communication systems in Greenland will certainly be part of the “underlayer” elements of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euronews.com/next/2026/01/19/what-is-donald-trumps-proposed-golden-dome-missile-defence-system-and-how-would-it-work#:~:text=US%20President%20Donald,or%20from%20space.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Golden Dome&lt;/a&gt; missile defense effort, allowing for Russian missiles of all varieties to be detected earlier and provide U.S. and Canadian warfighters additional reaction &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2026/01/20/us-news/greenland-critical-for-us-to-fend-off-icmbs-from-russia-and-beyond-experts/#:~:text=Doran%20explained%20that%20positioning%20Golden%20Dome%20interceptors%20in%20Greenland%20would%20give%20the%20US%20a%20bigger%20cushion%2C%20or%20margin%20of%20error%2C%20for%20detecting%20and%20shooting%20down%20an%20incoming%20nuke.%C2%A0&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia will always be a malevolent actor and adversary in the High North, and the Kremlin will utilize any advantage and division among Arctic allies to sow disinformation, destabilize alliance efforts, and advance its own interests. Although the political particularities of Nuuk lie in the hands of Greenland, Denmark, and the United States, the geostrategic and deterrence value of the island is shared among all NATO allies; and should be a factor that unifies and strengthens the alliance, not something that divides Western partners and advances adversarial interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery (U.S. Navy, ret.) is the Senior Director of the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation and Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), where Emmerson Overell is a project coordinator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>Export Controls Backfire: The China Innovation Paradox</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/export-controls-backfire-the-china-innovation-paradox</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/this-aerial-photograph-taken-on-january-14-2026-shows-the-building-housing-the-headquarters-of-chinese-ai-startup-deepseek-in-h.jpg?id=63688027&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C53%2C0%2C54&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export Controls Backfire: The China Innovation Paradox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP DIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;When the Biden administration rolled out its semiconductor export restrictions in October 2022, the logic seemed airtight: cut off Beijing’s access to advanced AI chips, and you’d put the brakes on China’s tech ambitions. Three years on, that bet looks a lot shakier than anyone in Washington expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of paralyzing China’s AI sector, these controls have promoted domestic self-reliance. With no choice but to develop indigenous workarounds and architectural innovations, Chinese businesses are&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-progress-semiconductors-and-implications-us-national-security&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;rapidly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; decoupling AI progress from sheer hardware volume. U.S. policies have undoubtedly bought time, but they have also ushered in a parallel innovation ecosystem totally independent of Western influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the Trump administration is trying a different tack. By allowing conditional chip&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-08/nvidia-set-to-win-us-approval-to-export-h200-ai-chips-to-china&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;exports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to approved Chinese customers, complete with revenue-sharing arrangements, the White House appears to be hedging its bets. The strategy banks on maintaining some leverage through controlled access rather than outright denial. Yet critics caution this could backfire spectacularly: American companies might be financing the very Chinese AI capabilities designed to render them&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/consequences-exporting-nvidias-h200-chips-china&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;obsolete&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both strategies, it seems, lead to uncomfortable places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The DeepSeek Shock and Algorithmic Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, DeepSeek’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;new&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;R1 model sent tremors through Silicon Valley and Washington. The Chinese startup demonstrated AI reasoning capabilities closely mirroring those of OpenAI’s ChatGPT o1, without access to cutting-edge chips restricted by U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Algorithmic efficiency is a useful technique that enables developers to achieve reasonable performance compared to frontier models through inference-time optimization—essentially adapting the achievements of others for your own purposes,” Martijn Rasser, Vice President of Tech Leadership at the Special Competitive Studies Project, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “DeepSeek’s engineering is genuinely impressive, and this ‘fast follower’ strategy is very attractive for price-sensitive, commoditized AI applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By optimizing inter-chip memory bandwidth on less sophisticated H800 chips, DeepSeek&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/27/1109346/deepseek-r1-ai-model-china-breakthrough/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;achieved&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; competitive performance through algorithmic efficiency rather than brute force. According to the MIT Technology Review, Chinese startups are responding to export restrictions by prioritizing efficiency, resource pooling, and collaboration, thereby gaining an edge over competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough, however, should not be overinterpreted, Rasser warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Algorithmic efficiency and raw compute aren’t substitutes at the frontier — you need both,” he says. “Training next-generation foundation models, achieving breakthroughs in areas like protein folding or materials science, and developing the most advanced autonomous systems all require massive compute that efficiency gains alone cannot replicate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today. Gain access to save your virtual seat now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other analysts see the dynamic playing out along different timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI progress is shaped by two concurrent trends: pushing the capability frontier requires ever-greater computing power, yet over time, reaching any given capability level requires less and less computing power,” James Sanders, Research Associate at the Center for a New American Security, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While American AI companies continue advancing along the compute-intensive frontier, Chinese firms constrained by chip shortages focus instead on the lower-cost, lower-capability portion of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the U.S. continues to maintain its computational dominance, China will likely continue to play a role as a fast follower, rather than leader, in AI capabilities,” Sanders explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smuggling Networks and Systematic Circumvention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from inventiveness under constraints, Chinese companies have also shown remarkable versatility by smuggling goods through shell companies and elaborate smuggling operations. The procurement of chips for Huawei’s Ascend 910 AI processor is one of the most dramatic examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Congressional&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2024/11/combating-threats-from-china-s-semiconductor-industry&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;testimony&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Huawei used shell companies to deceive Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company into manufacturing approximately 2 million computer chiplets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, a smuggling ring operating under the company name “Luxuriate Your Life” reportedly purchased $390 million worth of&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/us-prosecutors-charge-chinese-national-with-illegally-exporting-ai-chips-2024-10-25/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;servers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Dell and Supermicro containing banned Nvidia graphics processing units, then smuggled them into Malaysia for ultimate delivery to Chinese customers. Hundreds of controlled chips have subsequently been sold in Shenzhen markets as vendors trade restricted AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dramatic scale of smuggling operations thus raises fundamental questions about enforceability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No export control regime is 100% leakproof,” Rasser acknowledges. “But the goal should be making evasion costly, risky, and limited in scale rather than expecting perfect enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He contends that the most effective approach is drawing a clear line: semiconductors exceeding certain performance thresholds should not be sold to end users in countries of concern at all, regardless of stated end use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders takes a more optimistic view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“America has the ability to reduce AI chip smuggling to negligible levels if it wanted to. It only requires the political will to do so,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology that verifies a chip’s location could reduce smuggling to negligible levels, Sanders argues, noting that Nvidia has reportedly built such a capability and several congressional bills have proposed mandating location verification for exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even with the level of smuggling we see today, export controls on advanced AI chips are still effective,” Sanders insists. “They impose a large differential cost on China’s AI development and make it much harder for these chips to be obtained and used by adversaries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Self-Sufficiency Acceleration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most significantly for long-term strategic competition, export controls have supercharged China’s decades-long quest for semiconductor self-sufficiency. At a February 2025&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/deepseek-moment-chinas-ai-ambitions&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;meeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between Chinese Communist Party Chairman Xi Jinping and technology executives, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei reported that his previous concerns about domestic advanced semiconductor production had eased due to recent breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CSIS analysis underscores that Ren stated he is leading a network of more than 2,000 Chinese companies working collectively to ensure that China achieves self-sufficiency of more than 70 percent across the entire semiconductor value chain by 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rasser is skeptical of the ambitious timeline.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This timeline is not credible for leading-edge semiconductors,” Rasser observes. “If he means trailing-edge components and packaging, 2028 might be achievable. But if he means the advanced logic chips that power AI training and high-performance computing, it isn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese firms still can't build the ultra-precise manufacturing equipment needed to produce chips at the most advanced nodes, he points out. But that hasn't stopped Beijing from doubling down. Overall chip investment dipped slightly in early 2025, yet spending on semiconductor&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SIA_Government-Incentives-and-US-Competitiveness-in-Semiconductor-Manufacturing_Jul-2023.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;equipment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; jumped more than 53 percent, a clear signal that China is dead serious about building out a complete domestic supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government has channeled well over $150 billion into semiconductor&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semiconductors.org/strengthening-the-global-semiconductor-supply-chain-in-an-uncertain-era/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 2014 through 2030, according to Semiconductor Industry Association analysis — an investment equivalent to the U.S. CHIPS Act virtually every year since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bifurcation Dilemma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unintended consequence of U.S. export controls may be accelerating the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iss.europa.eu/content/tech-war-escalation-deeper-look-us-chip-export-controls&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;bifurcation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of global technology ecosystems into incompatible, competing supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, we are faced with a strategic paradox: Does a China that relies on Western chips but is constrained by American controls pose a lower long-term risk than one that operates in a technologically autonomous fashion beyond American eyesight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A technologically autonomous China certainly poses a greater risk of strategic surprise,” Rasser concedes. “But the alternative framing — that we could maintain Chinese dependency on Western technology indefinitely—isn’t realistic. It ignores history, Chinese strategy, decades of mercantilist industrial policy, and the inherent difficulty of controlling technology diffusion over long time horizons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The better frame, he suggests, is that export controls buy time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The question is what we do with that time,” Rasser continues. “Years of constrained Chinese progress are years during which the United States and allies can extend their own technological lead, build more resilient supply chains, strengthen alliances with key semiconductor nations, and shape the trajectory of AI governance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders echoes this assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“China is determined to develop a fully domestic AI chip industry, and will likely eventually be able to do so,” he notes. “The real question is whether we equip China to compete with American AI leadership today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fundamental constraint on Chinese domestic AI chip production, Sanders points out, isn’t the lack of logic chips but access to advanced manufacturing&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/securing-semiconductor-supply-chains&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;equipment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strengthening and fully enforcing current export restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment is the most important step in preventing China from developing an AI chip industry that could outcompete America’s,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the competitive landscape extends beyond manufacturing capacity alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supply Chain War&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leland Miller, co-founder and CEO of China Beige Book, who serves on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, however, sees the entire framework shifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The trade war is dead,” he tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “This is a supply chain war. Beijing wants to weaponize supply chains for leverage. Tariffs are background noise now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller notes that China has advantages in data, talent, energy, and scale. Their weakness remains computing — advanced chips and lithography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why H100s matter so much,” he says, referring to Nvidia’s high-end processors. On open-source AI platforms like&lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Chinese dominance is already evident. “Seventeen of the top 20 models are Chinese,” Mike Kuiken, Vice Chair of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Software plus enough hardware can close gaps. That’s why this moment is dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s December 2025&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/us-allows-conditional-export-nvidia-h200-chips-china-2025-12-15/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;decision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to allow conditional exports of Nvidia H200 chips to approved Chinese customers in exchange for a 25 percent revenue stake represents recognition that absolute denial may be neither achievable nor desirable. Yet Beijing has reportedly discouraged state-linked firms from adopting these chips, while Chinese companies like Huawei and Alibaba continue to advance domestic AI alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controls have bought time — China’s AI development has slowed, and the U.S. still holds the edge in cutting-edge tech. The more complex question is whether Washington can consolidate that lead before Beijing circumvents the restrictions entirely, potentially causing an even bigger crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal isn’t perpetual dependency, it’s ensuring that when China does achieve greater autonomy, the strategic balance still favors us,” Rasser concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's call for the rest of the world to join forces in managing a new era of economic and geopolitical turmoil will certainly resonate with national leaders worldwide. But the path to unity among middle powers is fraught, because interests within such a broad grouping rarely align.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Rise of China's Strategic Soft Power and its Global Impact</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-rise-of-china-s-strategic-soft-power-and-its-global-impact</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT PERSPECTIVE&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; The United States is currently mired in a cycle of aggressive trade renegotiations and a transactional foreign policy that has alienated its most critical allies. By perceiving partners as free riders on American defense investments, Washington is increasingly defaulting to raw financial and military coercion, or hard power. While cultural attraction remains a core Western strength, this shift toward transactionalism is allowing the global power balance to tilt decisively in China’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has successfully evolved from the world’s manufacturing engine into an innovation powerhouse, with massive investments in research and development now yielding strategic dividends. The old adage, &quot;USA innovates, China replicates, Europe regulates,&quot; is being rendered obsolete as Beijing takes the lead in high-tech research, dominates renewable energy supply chains, and weaponizes its monopoly on rare earth materials. This is not just a technological shift; it is the foundation of a new form of systemic influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soft power, the ability to influence through attraction rather than coercion, is now a primary battleground for Beijing. In its 2010-2015 5-Year Plan, China explicitly identified cultural products like computer animation, books, and social media as strategic priorities, and is expected to spend over $10Bn per year. Today, that strategy is manifest in TikTok, where international audiences are fed a curated diet of technological wonders and friendly diplomacy, while the domestic version (Douyin) remains strictly regulated. This curated reality leverages Western influencers paid to travel to China to marvel at bullet trains and flying cars, effectively masking the tightening grip of government control and persistent domestic poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silver screen has become a frontier for this historical revisionism. The evolution of Oriental Dreamworks illustrates the point: after the original Kung Fu Panda sparked national soul-searching in China over why a Western studio told their story better, Beijing forced a co-production model. This ensured that subsequent global hits, like The Abominable, which sparked international backlash for including the nine-dash line, served as vehicles for Chinese territorial and cultural narratives. Similarly, the success of The Three-Body Problem on platforms like Netflix signals a shift from passive consumption to the strategic export of techno-optimism, reshaping how the West perceives China’s past and future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately one of China’s most potent soft power assets, however, is its strategic silence. In a world defined by shock events, from the 2025 Indo-Pakistani conflict to the Venezuelan raids to arguing over Greenland, Beijing projects a calculated lack of surprise. While United States foreign policy is viewed as an erratic series of active disruptions, China markets itself as a pillar of stability. By refusing the role of global savior, Beijing avoids the inevitable backlash of interventions while presenting its intentions, most notably regarding Taiwan, as historic certainties rather than chaotic ruptures. This perceived predictability is the velvet glove that makes its authoritarian consistency look like a safe harbor for global markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/15/views-of-the-us-have-worsened-while-opinions-of-china-have-improved-in-many-surveyed-countries/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2025 Pew Research Center survey &lt;/a&gt;of 28,000 adults shows the favorability gap between Washington and Beijing closing fast. Even inner circle partners are decoupling: in &lt;strong&gt;Australia&lt;/strong&gt;, importance placed on economic ties with China (53%) has eclipsed the U.S. (42%) for the first time. In &lt;strong&gt;Canada&lt;/strong&gt;, reeling from American rhetoric regarding annexation and the Greenland crisis, favorability for the United States plummeted from 87% to 67%. &lt;strong&gt;Spain&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Mexico&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Brazil &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Argentina &lt;/strong&gt;all view the United States as their highest threat, while the &lt;strong&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;France&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Netherlands&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Germany &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Sweden &lt;/strong&gt;think of the United States as their second highest threat, only surpassed by &lt;strong&gt;Russia&lt;/strong&gt;. When the world’s most stable democracies begin to view the United States as a greater threat to their sovereignty than China, the global architecture of power has already moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This erosion between the United States and its NATO allies is precipitating a tangible financial and geopolitical divorce. As European pension funds signal a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rog0QA0s3WI&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pivot toward non-American assets and gold&lt;/a&gt; to hedge against United States volatility, Washington has resorted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-warns-retaliation-europe-sells-141827096.html?guccounter=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hard-power retaliation&lt;/a&gt;, to counter rising interest costs on its own federal debt, but risks further alienating allies. This shift is giving rise to a Western middle-power bloc, where leaders from Canada to the U.K. are bypassing United States hegemony to secure autonomous ties with Beijing, most recently shown in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm24k6kk1rko&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canadian trade deal with China&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-approves-china-plan-its-largest-embassy-europe-despite-espionage-fears-2026-01-20/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;London approving a new embassy&lt;/a&gt; before their prime minister is set to visit China next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Domestic Crisis of American Soft Power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States faces a disadvantage in this competition that is as much internal as it is external. While cultural attraction remains a Western strength, America is stuck in a cycle of political division and a pervasive internal culture war. This domestic fragmentation has direct geopolitical consequences, creating a soft power deficit by eroding internal stability and the reliability that allies previously took for granted. When a superpower’s domestic policy is defined by institutional distrust and crippling polarization, its foreign policy becomes erratic, swinging violently between administrations and leaving partners to wonder if today’s agreement will survive tomorrow’s election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this climate, Washington is increasingly defaulting to financial and military coercion, hard power, to maintain influence. By viewing alliances through a purely transactional lens, the United States signals that its leadership is no longer based on shared values, but on momentary leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Authoritarian Impact of the Chinese Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, China’s authoritarian system provides a strategic soft power advantage by ensuring internal dissent never detracts from international ambitions. While the United States is distracted by internal quibbling over social issues, Beijing’s centralized control allows it to project a facade of unwavering stability and consistency. The CCP’s absolute control over society prevents political in-fighting from slowing its global expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marketed reliability is a powerful tool. To many developing nations, the Chinese model, which prioritizes state security and economic growth over the perceived chaos of liberal democracy, looks increasingly attractive. China is expertly using this image to mask the reality of structural debt traps and economic coercion they have expertly laid in the Global South, particularly in Africa and Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this is also China’s greatest weakness. Democratic values, such as a free press, labor rights, data and public privacy and private ownership are values where the West, and America in particular, still is attractive and acts as a magnet. While China might be a partner, they might not be a role model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Collision Course with an Existential Vacuum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Transatlantic alliance is now on a collision course with an existential power vacuum. If the West fails to move past aggressive theater and nurture shared security architectures, it will cede the century to a model that demands compliance in exchange for short-term financial benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For any nation flirting with realignment toward China, the warning is stark: China offers immediate liquidity, but demands a level of sovereign collateral that eventually leaves the partner more vulnerable than it was before the investment began, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-economic-coercion-lessons-lithuania&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lithuania’s experience&lt;/a&gt; with economic sanctions has shown. Old alliances between America and Europe should not be so quickly forgotten. All indications are that Chinese soft power, backed by an undistracted authoritarian state, could eventually be followed by hard power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soft power should not be discarded so quickly. There is strength in a shared Western cultural heritage that attracts nations precisely because it avoids totalitarianism. However, if America cannot find a way to resolve its internal dissent and project a unified front, it risks losing the very American Example that once served as its greatest global asset, and part of its allies with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deterrence fails not only when threats to act or retaliate lack credibility, but when the absence of credibility tempts adversaries into recklessness. A leader like Donald Trump, who cannot commit and is disloyal to even his closest allies, is not merely ineffective; he is dangerous because he tempts adversaries to act recklessly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>America’s Intelligence Satellites are Proliferating: Their Protection is Not, With Exceptions</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/americas-intelligence-satellites-are-proliferating-their-protection-is-not-with-exceptions</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;The pace of U.S. national-security launches over the past several months has been staggering. But buried beneath the impressive cadence is an uncomfortable truth: many of the most sensitive intelligence assets now orbiting Earth remain dangerously exposed to enemy action by hostile actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These assets are launched primarily by the National Reconnaissance Office and the U.S. Space Force Space Systems Command, operating under the National Security Space Launch program (NSSL). The government’s private-sector partners - SpaceX and United Launch Alliance (a joint-venture by Lockheed Martin and Boeing) provide the lift capacity using Falcon 9, the soon to enter operations Falcon Heavy (SpaceX), and the newly introduced Vulcan Centaur rocket (ULA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress has long recognized the importance of assured access to space. As the Congressional Research Service &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.jumpto.es/l/178c4d348dbce6e83dbaf7399ea03e15eec2b93c?notrack=1&amp;amp;u=179354&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. law mandates maintaining at least two launch vehicles capable of delivering any national-security payload to orbit. That policy has worked. The problem is what happens after launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past four years, most NRO launches fall into three categories. First are signals-intelligence satellites (SIGINT). Second are large, electro-optical imaging satellites (IMINT) - capable of extraordinary resolution, as the public briefly glimpsed when Donald Trump released an undegraded intelligence &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.jumpto.es/l/ae2956f5297b55ecee975f224fd7fd89cf3a0d0f?notrack=1&amp;amp;u=179354&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; in a startling lapse of operational security. Third are the Starshield (the name of the program) satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proliferated Architecture represents a strategic shift; its &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.jumpto.es/l/49522628c681abff983fa37fef6a40ecbe6f84bb?notrack=1&amp;amp;u=179354&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; is to establish &lt;em&gt;“the largest government constellation in history” &lt;/em&gt;consisting of hundreds of satellites with launches planned through 2029. There are roughly half a dozen missions planned for 2026. This project replaces the model of few exquisite, irreplaceable satellites, in favor of resilience through numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That logic is sound - but it applies unevenly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proliferation ensures continuity if adversaries degrade or destroy some satellites. Yet the most sensitive NRO platforms - large SIGINT collectors and high-resolution imaging satellites - remain singular, expensive, and irreplaceable. They are also increasingly vulnerable. Both China and Russia are fielding counterspace capabilities that include electronic warfare, cyber intrusion, co-orbital inspection satellites, and direct-ascent anti-satellite weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today. Gain access to save your virtual seat now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, America is hardening its communications backbone while leaving its crown jewels exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deterrence in space no longer comes from secrecy alone. It requires active protection: improved space-domain awareness, on-orbit maneuverability, electronic countermeasures, rapid reconstitution plans, and – ultimately - the willingness to impose costs on adversaries who threaten U.S. space assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has demonstrated it can launch fast, often, and at scale. The next challenge is more difficult and more urgent: ensuring that the satellites underpinning American military power and intelligence dominance can survive in a contested orbital environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starshield redundancy is a start. Protection of existing assets must be the next step. if a rival has the ability to blind, deceive, or degrade satellites, then a lack of clarity may emerge exactly when clarity is most needed. A lack of clarity in a crisis is a catalyst. In fact, space is crowded, competitive, and, more to the point, contested. The dangers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, kinetic anti-satellite weapons (ASAT) and debris. Anti-satellite weapons, such as one that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.jumpto.es/l/8eb465dc05d8e7c1dfd0a0c3bb758949b800c830?notrack=1&amp;amp;u=179354&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tested by China in 2007&lt;/a&gt; are some of the most threatening because they have the capability to destroy a satellite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, non-kinetic attacks, like dazzling, jamming, cyber-tampering, and spoofing. The greatest threats on a daily basis are also likely to be non-kinetic, meaning they are temporary or reversible, although still potentially operationally decisive. A threat &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.jumpto.es/l/8a6a1c6ba93ad27649db1954f3182e71cb2bcf4e?notrack=1&amp;amp;u=179354&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;assessment&lt;/a&gt; has found categories of threats such as electronic warfare, cyber, and directed-energy effects that are being developed and employed by hostile nations as part of their counter-space capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, co-orbital proximity operations and grey-zone activity. Proximity operations are activities that are legitimate in themselves. However, the same activities can be used for coercion, interference, and &lt;em&gt;“accidents on purpose.”&lt;/em&gt; The issue in this regard is one of attribution. This leads to a gray zone in which norms are important in addition to deterrence. In this regard, the U.S. Space Force has described space domain awareness (SDA) as &lt;em&gt;“the ability to perceive and understand the nature of space-based phenomena to inform &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://l.jumpto.es/l/299979f1c6cdba01aa3882a1e888fd6564cf5b1d?notrack=1&amp;amp;u=179354&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;decisions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy should be to combine these elite systems with more distributed architectures: more nodes, more paths, and more means of recovery. Resilience is about the need to ensure that the loss of one satellite’s signal does not cause the end of the entire mission. The Proliferated Architecture (Starshield) program is a step towards that direction. But it’s only one NRO project in place and has redundancies set in place. What can be done to protect other multi-billion satellites already in orbit and not part of a constellation of satellites?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, apply maneuver, unpredictability and mobility in space, which comes down to strong cyber protection for mission systems and ground networks, encryption and authentication to protect command and telemetry, anti-jamming techniques and alternative communication routes and rigorous integrity checks, such that analysts can rely on the data generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, engage in rapid reconstitution and continuity of operations including: pre-planned fallback modes, alternate tasking workflows, ground processing surge capacity, and alternatives for reconstituting capability with allied or commercial sources if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the problem is narrowed down to its core, ensuring the protection of single-operated NRO satellites can be achieved via better access to sensor data and faster decision cycles and a resilient architecture (combination of high-end assets and proliferated assets).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally important are end-to-end cybersecurity and integrity controls, debris-conscious operations &amp; sustainability in coordination with civilian agencies such as NASA where necessary and proactive deterrence through resilience and consequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NRO satellites are strategic tools, as they reduce uncertainties, detect deception, and enable decision advantage. The threats to these satellites, which are both kinetic and non-kinetic, are rapidly increasing in their sophistication and frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protection of such satellites has nothing to do with making space a battlefield for its own sake. It has to do with being able to see clearly enough to avoid mistakes that could escalate quickly in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to ensure such protection is not through a single technology but through a comprehensive approach that involves situational awareness, resilience, secure data communication, sustainable operations, deterrence and dispersion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump’s bullying of allies and fallacious arguments have put the US on a collision course with disaster, winning only rare plaudits, notably from the likes of Vladimir Putin.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In his landmark Davos speech, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney urged the world’s middle powers to band together, or else risk being dominated by the United States and China.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;National Rally’s Jordan Bardella has emerged as the frontrunner in France’s presidential race, confronting the European Union with the prospect of a far-right Euroskeptic in the Elysée.
