      <title>China’s Stunning Military Purge – and What It Means For Taiwan</title>

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/zhang-youxia-first-ranked-vice-chairman-of-the-cmc-attends-the-opening-ceremony-of-the-chinese-people-s-political-consultative.jpg?id=63513488&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C53%2C0%2C54&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP DIVE – &lt;/strong&gt;President Xi Jinping’s latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d0l0g8yz5o&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;purge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of generals has eviscerated China’s military leadership, drawn comparisons to crackdowns carried out by Chairman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hoover.org/research/lin-biao-incident-and-peoples-liberation-army-purges&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mao Zedong&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a half century ago, and raised questions about China’s military plans for a takeover of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xi moved in the past week against China’s most senior military official, General Zhang Youxai, and General Liu Zhenli, who heads the Joint Staff Department, which oversees operations, intelligence and training. Zhang and Liu were members of the Central Military Commission, or CMC, China’s most important military body – and Xi’s campaign has now claimed all but two of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/expressions/purge-zhang-youxia-reading-chinas-army-party-relations-through-tea-leaves&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;CMC’s six leaders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (one of whom is Xi himself). Xi’s earlier purges have ended the careers of dozens of lower-ranking generals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The PLA’s core command has been mutilated by these purges,” Dr. Zi Yang, an expert on China’s military at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. As for the CMC, he said that “this organization…that is supposed to oversee quality military advice is more or less gutted. Who’s giving Xi advice on running an organization of two million military personnel?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine an American president firing all but one member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with several other high-ranking generals, while simultaneously preparing for a major military contingency, and you have some sense of what’s happening in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis Wilder, who served as a senior CIA official and a top White House adviser on China, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/china/2026/01/24/what-xi-jinpings-purge-of-chinas-most-senior-general-reveals&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;called&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the moves against Generals Zhang and Liu the “most stunning developments in Chinese politics” since Xi’s rise to power – and said the purges would almost certainly affect any moves against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If Xi had plans for 2027, I think they’re delayed,” Wilder told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, referring to Xi’s directive that the military be prepared by 2027 to take taiwan by force. “I don't know for how long but they have to be delayed at this point. There's no way that they're ready to take on a major military confrontation in these circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gen. Zhang was widely considered Xi’s most trusted military aide. Former U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who attended a &lt;a href=&quot;https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/readout-of-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivans-meeting-with-vice-chairman-of-the-central-military-commission-zhang-youxia-of-the-prc/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;meeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with Zhang in 2024, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;that he “spoke in an unvarnished way that was typical of a military guy, but also reflective of someone who didn’t feel like he had to be cautious.” Now Gen. Zhang is the latest and most consequential casualty of Xi’s widening purge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s fair to say this is a seismic event,” Sullivan said. For Xi to “take out somebody who he had such a long history with is striking, and raises a lot of questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anatomy of a crackdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 24th the Defense Ministry announced that Generals Zhang and Liu had been placed under investigation for “suspected serious discipline and law violations”. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.ph/3AYwV&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;editorial&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in China’s&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Liberation Army Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; said the two men had “trampled on” Xi’s authority and “severely undermined the party’s absolute leadership over the military.” Their actions, the paper said, had caused “massive damage” to the military’s political strength and combat readiness. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/china/chinas-top-general-accused-of-giving-nuclear-secrets-to-u-s-b8f59dae?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqc7eOBnepRsB3zOUMzXCx-OIWjKhBsH3_Gr7HKG4aus02Idlr9tAzQvrwK2yTE%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=697a4482&amp;amp;gaa_sig=bVwB7qjAHpuqirsR5vAE5eiaDRiWmrJVcOs2VP5fsIr03VTCkr9mVOZsGF7lzs7H-F8D4SeM0dY36_kB-eLNsQ%3D%3D&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that General Zhang has been accused of leaking nuclear secrets to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts had assumed that Gen. Zhang would avoid the purges, given his rare combination of attributes: a decades-long close relationship with Xi; and a decorated record during the 1979 border war with Vietnam. Few current commanders in China have experienced combat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Zhang matters, both as a combat-tested veteran – which is a very rare commodity within the PLA – but also because he truly understands war.” Shanshan Mei, a China defense expert at RAND and former advisor to the U.S. Air Force on China, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “He truly understands tactics and morale and real combat issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

He &lt;a href=&quot;http://v&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fired&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dozens of generals and began an overhaul of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), which was ultimately led by Gen. Zhang. Xi’s purging of the CMC leadership &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/china/2026/01/24/what-xi-jinpings-purge-of-chinas-most-senior-general-reveals&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;began in 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and culminated in last week’s moves against Zhang and Liu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Dr. Zi – the RSIS expert – wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamestown.org/five-key-factors-behind-irregular-leadership-changes-in-the-peoples-liberation-army/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;article&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about the purges and argued that Zhang Youxia’s removal would likely trigger a crisis within the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Now, Zi says, that moment has arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's going to have trickle-down effects for sure to the operational level,” Zi told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;“All of Zhang’s associates are going to be put under suspicion. All of Zhang’s underlings are going to feel the pressure as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it means for Taiwan – and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;that the latest ousters will likely have several immediate effects: a drop in PLA morale; less high-level risk-taking and innovation; a disruption in decision-making – involving everything from procurement to high-tech modernization to actual priorities and battle plans; and an almost-certain delay in any military operations against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambassador Joseph DeTrani, a former CIA director of East Asia operations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/inside-xi-jinpings-military-purge-loyalty-power-and-taiwan&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote an article&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;in October in which he warned that the high-level upheaval within the PLA might impact decisions involving Taiwan. Now he says that delays are inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got to say this is not going to happen [by 2027],” Amb. DeTrani told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “And if it is, you have got to wonder, what sort of planning and what sort of leadership would go in? I just don't see how President Xi Jinping could feel even remotely confident that China’s military would be prepared, or is prepared, to use kinetic means to take over Taiwan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zi said that the purging of the two top generals “has clearly damaged the PLA’s operational capacity,” and he, too, doubted that the military could move against Taiwan until the internal turbulence passes and a new leadership is put in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any war in the Taiwan Strait is going to be an extremely complex large-scale military operation,” Zi said. “It will require the mobilization of China’s resources in all realms and mobilization of basically all military services and forces. You need people who are capable and talented in positions to plan and lead these operations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilder said that while China’s basic military readiness is not in question – “pilots know how to fly their planes…(and) naval and infantry commanders know how to lead their units,” he said – the latest purges will compromise the oversight and execution of any major operations in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think this changes the readiness of PLA forces,” he said. “It’s really about the command structure. I think execution is a problem, because your command structure has been so disrupted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That “command structure” has been housed within the CMC, whose only remaining uniformed officer is Gen. Zhang Shengmin, who Zi described as a “political commissar with next to no operational command experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s not a combat veteran,” Wilder said of Zhang Shengmin. “You have to find a general in charge, if you're going to go forward with a plan. Who’s your operational commander?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Taiwan, Wilder said the purges risk a broader “paralysis” within the military’s top echelons. “You don't know what's safe anymore, and whether you might be investigated,” he said. “Officers will want to keep their heads down. They won’t want to propose anything. They will simply wait for instructions.” That, he added, will render the military leadership “dysfunctional for a while. It becomes incapable of serious decision-making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said decision-making wasn’t a problem for Gen. Zhang Youxia, who was seen as a straight-shooting advisor who wouldn’t hesitate to give Xi a less-than-rosy assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Zhang could give Xi Jinping critical advice and know that Xi would listen,” RAND’s Mei said. “A key question now is: Who is going to give Xi Jinping the Zhang Youxai-style, informed and combat-tested advice, if Xi decides to make any big moves militarily? Who’s going to give him the honest opinion?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amb. DeTrani said that morale at lower ranks will be challenged as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's got to affect the troops,” DeTrani said. “What is the message that Xi Jinping is sending to the troops – that his leaders are all either corrupt or involved in other nefarious activities? It's got to be very demoralizing for the core of the People's Liberation Army.” He said frontline soldiers may go so far as to question their own commitments. “I've been taking orders from these people and told to potentially give up my life to serve the country – and these people are feeding off the trough? They're corrupt and we're hearing that from our supreme leader? How could they expect us to sacrifice so much if they're not invested the same way as we are?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who will take their place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the near term, all eyes will be on the generals Xi taps to fill the vacancies – and how soon he does so. Wilder said that one of his “best contacts” inside China told him in the wake of the moves against Zhang and Liu that “There’s more coming. There are going to be other generals that go.” Any further bloodletting would suggest an extended period without a fully reconstituted top brass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever Xi chooses to fill the top-tier positions, he will presumably be looking for loyalists who also bring experience and expertise. But experts said that the trickle-down effect of the purges means that many candidates may be tainted by association to the ousted generals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In China, when you take down one person, everything about that person is wrong,” Mei said. “Who is going to replace Zhang? We keep looking one level down, to the theater commanders and political commissars. But many of these people were Zhang Youxian proteges. You take him out, it doesn’t mean that you will have a big collection of qualified, loyal military leaders ready to take over.” She added that among China’s ten theater commanders, “at least 4 or 5 are Zhang Youxian’s people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today.

The ideal citizens were &quot;Red and Expert&quot; – people who brought both elements to their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The real question is, can he find the loyalists he needs in those jobs?” Wilder said. “Does he have a slate of candidates? I would presume he cannot leave these positions open for too long.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My gut feeling tells me that Xi is valuing loyalty over professionalism,” Zi said. “A military professional may tell you things that you don’t want to hear. If he cannot find someone who is both ‘Red’ and ‘expert,’ he is going to choose someone who is loyal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zi and others added that whoever lands in these positions will have to tread carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They will have to be extremely cautious about their behavior, their words, they must carry themselves in a more subservient way,” Zi said. “Maybe even total obedience to Xi’s will and Xi’s mind. Because you don't want to put yourself in the same position as Zhang. And they won’t have anything like his capital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outside China, watching with interest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in Taiwan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-monitoring-abnormal-china-military-leadership-changes-after-top-general-2026-01-26/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week that they were closely monitoring what they called “abnormal shifts” within China’s senior military leadership. That said, Defense Minister Wellington Koo projected a nothing-has-changed approach, saying Taipei would not relax its guard, and noting that China’s war games have continued and Beijing has not changed its position vis-a-vis Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mei, Zi and Wilder all raised a concern about another regional flashpoint: The South China Sea. In their view, Xi may seek to quiet domestic concerns about the PLA – and send the rest of the world a message – by initiating a smaller-scale conflict involving those disputed waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would worry about the South China Sea, because Xi might want to prove that he’s still strong,” Wilder said. “So what do you do? You pick on a small guy. I’d worry about the Philippines. I think we’re going to have to watch for muscle-flexing of some sort.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zi voiced the same concern, suggesting Xi might seek a “rally-the-flag” operation in the South China Sea – a “small conflict that might be viewed as easy pickings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the U.S., the chaos in China’s military leadership offers at least one benefit: the gift of time, as Washington and its Asian allies consider the range of contingencies involving Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You've got a wonderful opportunity,” Wilder said. “Number one, you have time that you didn't have before. We have all these Indo-Pacom plans, we're trying to get AI in the field, drone swarms into the field. It gives us a longer timeline for working with the Japanese, the Philippines, the Australians. That's the good news.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Both US and Chinese leaders are guilty of personalizing the conflict-prone Sino-American relationship. Continuing down this path – particularly if Donald Trump’s degradation of American leadership becomes a permanent shift, rather than an aberration – raises the important question of which country is truly exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The announcement of a skeletal agreement between US President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte was good news, even if it turns out to be a fig leaf for a failed land grab. The brouhaha over Trump’s rhetoric was obscuring what is a genuinely serious geostrategic concern.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although Israel’s recent deal to supply natural gas to Egypt offers many strategic and economic benefits, it also carries serious risks. Without careful planning, future Israeli governments may find themselves forced to choose between honoring export obligations and safeguarding domestic energy security.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite Donald Trump's varying threats against Greenland, the United States has not yet crossed the line into empire, because Greenlandic and Danish consent still matters. Instead, it remains a hegemon that can pressure and persuade without displacing local authority.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Across much of the world, Gen Z-led protests have become proxies for broader discontent, fueled by deep and persistent governance failures rather than isolated events. These are not episodic flare-ups, but rather expressions of widespread frustration with the yawning gap between policy commitments and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US intervention in Venezuela and seizure of its oil may dominate headlines, but a more consequential shift in US energy policy is unfolding off-camera.

      <title>Europe’s  Best Tools for Countering Trump</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;European exporters depend more on the US market than American exporters do on Europe, which means the EU is poorly positioned for a tit-for-tat tariff war with the US. But with targeted export tariffs, taxes on royalties, and the elimination of US Treasuries' risk-free status, the EU could hit the US where it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Update on Venezuela, Post Maduro Apprehension</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/an-update-on-venezuela-post-maduro-apprehension</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT PERSPECTIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;Turmoil in Minneapolis and the unprecedented friction within NATO over President Trump’s effort to secure control over Greenland have, predictably, displaced headlines about Venezuela in much of the daily press. But there have been at least a number of important statements from the U.S. and one disturbing statement, reportedly, by Venezuela’s interim president since the U.S. apprehended Maduro and his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;”Now, this is not the end. This is not even the beginning of the end”&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Winston Churchill, 1942&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, in a press conference, President Trump said he was considering a role for Venezuela’s democratic opposition leader, Nobel laureate Maria Corina Machado. This was a very encouraging statement. The opposition has the support of the vast majority of Venezuelans. As has been widely reported and well documented, they won the July 24 national election by an enormous margin despite regime efforts to undermine their campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria Corina Machado is the leader of the opposition and a national hero. She is committed to rebuilding her country’s democracy and to reconstructing Venezuela’s dysfunctional and corruption-ridden economy. She is pro-American, pro-private sector and open to foreign direct investment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regime, now being led on an interim basis by Delcy Rodriquez, held on to power after the July 2024 vote through intimidation. The Venezuelan public knows this. And, despite assurances of cooperation to President Trump, there are already signs that the character of this authoritarian regime’s approach to governance has not changed. The regime moved quickly after the U.S. removed Maduro to squelch public expressions of relief that Maduro had been taken into U.S. custody. Left to their own devices, Delcy Rodriquez and company will do everything in their power to consolidate their hold on power. Indeed, this is clear from Rodriguez’s recent public statement that she has had “enough already of Washington’s orders over Venezuelan politicians.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating Maria Corina Machado into the transition process would reassure her supporters and help to counter the impression that the U.S. is indifferent to the plight of the Venezuelan democratic opposition. It would also contribute to the establishment of the kind of security on the ground that the American oil majors have said must be achieved before they commit to the immense investments necessary to resurrect the country much diminished and dilapidated oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump says the U.S. will manage the receipts for Venezuelan oil sales and direct some of that money back into Venezuela. Good but these funds should be channeled mostly into the hands of the opposition rather than the regime. Indeed, the last thing that should be done with the oil receipts is giving them to the regime. The regime’s managerial incompetence and corrupt practices are precisely what caused the effective collapse of the economy! As I and others have noted in the past, oil production in Venezuela has shrunk by two thirds since Hugo Chavez was elected. Things got even worse under Nicolas Maduro. The Venezuelan economy contracted by around 70 percent between 2013, when Maduro assumed the presidency, and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s decision to work with remaining elements of the Maduro regime’s leadership cadre was and remains understandable. The U.S. wants to avoid the mistakes we made after the fall of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. The regime’s remaining leaders, however, are never going to be willing partners in the reconstruction of, Venezuela if that means empowering their adversaries – as Delcy Rodriguez’s recent comment makes clear. They are counting on the U.S. losing interest or being distracted by other crises. The United States needs to be prepared to counter this heretofore unstated impression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. considered this a criminal regime before Maduro was apprehended. Rodriquez and the ministers of Defense and Interior were all a part of Maduro’s inner circle. They are miscreants who will revert to their previous patterns of repression and malfeasance absent close vigilance by the U.S. and the democratic opposition. This is why President Trump’s decision to get American diplomats back into the country and name a tough, experienced ambassador to lead the Venezuelan interest section presently located in Bogota was so important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has a long list of issues to work through with the Rodriquez team. Following Maduro’s capture, Rodriguez, on behalf of the regime, agreed to work with the U.S. to avoid further U.S. military action. We will need to watch carefully to be assured that commitments are met. We should also communicate persuasively that the U.S. is willing to act forcefully again if the circumstances warrant it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>Inside Trump’s New ‘Board of Peace’</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/inside-trumps-new-board-of-peace</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION &lt;/strong&gt;— “Donald J. Trump shall serve as inaugural Chairman of the Board of Peace, and he shall separately serve as inaugural representative of the United States of America…The Chairman [Trump] shall have exclusive authority to create, modify, or dissolve subsidiary entities as necessary or appropriate to fulfill the Board of Peace’s mission…The Chairman [Trump] shall at all times designate a successor for the role of Chairman. Replacement of the Chairman [Trump] may occur only following voluntary resignation or as a result of incapacity, as determined by a unanimous vote of the Executive Board, at which time the Chairman’s [Trump’s] designated successor shall immediately assume the position of the Chairman and all associated duties and authorities of the Chairman.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are quotes from the charter of the new, so-called Bureau of Peace (BOP) established by President Trump and signed January 22, at Davos, Switzerland by Trump for the United States and the leaders or representatives of 19 other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 16, White House announcement of BOP said the organization would provide “strategic oversight, mobilizing international resources, and ensuring accountability as Gaza transitions from conflict to peace and development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, six days later the BOP charter that President Trump released at Davos described its purpose in Chapter I this way: “The Board of Peace is an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No mention of Gaza, as BOP’s sole focus, but rather the far broader “areas affected or threatened by conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOP’s expansion to a worldwide peacekeeping role provides President Trump with a new way to involve himself in international affairs, not just while he is U.S. President, but even after he leaves the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will discuss below how President Trump sees all this happening and what it may mean. First, however, it’s worth seeing how BOP’s charter, gives its Chairman, Trump, total power over the organization even beyond what’s mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example,, the charter says. “Membership in the Board of Peace is limited to States invited to participate by the Chairman…Each Member State shall serve a term of no more than three years from this Charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the Chairman…The Executive Board shall be selected by the Chairman…shall serve two-year terms, subject to removal by the Chairman and renewable at his discretion…[and] shall be led by a Chief Executive nominated by the Chairman and confirmed by a majority vote of the Executive Board…Decisions of the Executive Board shall be made by a majority of its members present and voting, including the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive. Such decisions shall go into effect immediately, subject to veto by the Chairman at any time thereafter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Chairman Trump, under the charter, shall convene BOP meetings, establish their locations, must approve the agendas and the persons from all states attending those meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individually, the charter says Chairman Trump, “acting on behalf of the Board of Peace, is authorized to adopt resolutions or other directives, consistent with this Charter, to implement the Board of Peace’s mission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Chairman, Trump can also “dissolve [BOP] at such time as the Chairman considers necessary or appropriate, or at the end of every odd-numbered calendar year&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;unless renewed by the Chairman&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;no later than November 21 of such odd-numbered calendar year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charter says, “The Executive Board shall provide for the rules and procedures with respect to the settling of all assets, liabilities, and obligations upon [BOP’s] dissolution,” but remember, decisions of the Executive Board are “subject to veto by the Chairman at any time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the BOP charter gives Trump total control over the organization and all its activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last Thursday’s press conference introducing BOP, Trump said, “This Board [BOP] has the chance to be one of the most consequential bodies ever created and it's my enormous honor to serve as its chairman. I was very honored when they asked me to do it. We had an idea to do it, and then they came. They said, &quot;You be the chairman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump never explained who “they” were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although 50 nations had been invited to join BOP, only 19 showed up to attend last Thursday’s announcement. Major Western allies, such as Canada, France and Germany have balked and voiced concerns that the body is designed to replace the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, who just recently had the U.S. withdraw from many U.N. organizations, said at last Thursday BOP press conference, “I've always said the United Nations has got tremendous potential, has not used it, but there's tremendous potential in the United Nations and you have some great people at the United Nations, but so far it hasn't.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He repeated, “There's tremendous potential with the United Nations and I think the combination of the Board of Peace with the kind of people we have here coupled with the United Nations can be something very, very unique for the world, for the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the Trump approved as the BOP seal something in gold that’s very similar to that of the U.N. seal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who helped put together BOP and is a founding member of its Executive Board, said at last Thursday’s event, he had put together a plan for rebuilding Gaza with the help of the U.N. as the Security Council had originally voted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then Kushner added, “We've worked very, very well with them, this is why you need a new organization like the Board of Peace to work with the U.N.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kushner specifically thanked U.N.’s Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Tom Fletcher, who it turns out gave an interview to &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt; at the time of the BOP announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fletcher insisted, “The U.N. is not going anywhere…We’ve got to get out there, end wars, save lives, and we’re doing that.” Asked if Trump’s organization would replace the U.N., Fletcher responded, “Now I think we’re seeing America wanting to play a part in ending some of these conflicts and they want us [the U.N.] to be as effective as we can be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fletcher then gave a description of what I judge he sees as Trump’s different way of looking at how he, Trump, works with world leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fletcher said. “There’s a difference between the old school statecraft that’s familiar to many people here at Davos and a sort of real estate craft, which is coming into this conversation now, which is more transactional. It’s very focused on results, not process. It’s focused on personal relationships and not always institutions. Yes, there’s an aspect of cliff-hanger and jeopardy to it. We never quite know what’s coming next, but it is part of the conversation. And if it can save lives and it ends wars then that is fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me that is roll-the-dice diplomacy – in effect gambling on national security and foreign policy outcomes. Remember, Trump’s Atlantic City ventures that started in the 1980s. By 2004, all three Trump casinos and Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts Inc. were bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, has rolled the dice on Venezuela, let’s see how that turns out. And hopefully, BOP won’t be like Trump’s casinos, although right now it does not look to me like a good gamble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>Russia’s War Economy Lifeline: Inside the Sanctions Evasion Network</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russias-war-economy-lifeline-inside-the-sanctions-evasion-network</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/18-january-2026-russia-moscow-the-kremlin-and-the-skyscraper-district-of-the-city-glow-in-the-afternoon-sun.jpg?id=63292808&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C53%2C0%2C54&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP DIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;Nearly three years into the most comprehensive sanctions regime ever imposed on a significant economy, Russia’s defense industrial base has not just survived — it has expanded at a rate that has stunned Western officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of Western import controls, Moscow maintains wartime levels of military production by using shell companies, third-country middlemen, and financial workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2026, the war will enter its fourth year, and Russia will still have access to&lt;a href=&quot;https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/00594bef40bc4148b16dc7267172d033&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;critical&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;battlefield technology that was banned by Western authorities. These components power the Lancet loitering munitions hitting Ukrainian positions, Kalibr cruise missiles striking infrastructure, and electronic warfare systems jamming NATO communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2025, Russia&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-nato-weapons-production-us-germany/33482927.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;produced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an estimated 250,000 artillery shells monthly — 3 million annually — according to NATO intelligence, while manufacturing over 1.5 million drones and more than 2,400 cruise and ballistic missiles per year. President Vladimir Putin&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-boosted-weapon-production-22-times-since-start-of-ukraine-war-putin-9998154&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;claimed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in April that Russia’s defense industry more than doubled production of weapons, communications, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare systems over the previous year, with ammunition production increasing more than 22-fold since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also assessed in January 2025 that Russia has fully switched to a “war economy” and produces, in three months, the weapons and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nato.int/en/news-and-events/events/transcripts/2025/05/21/joint-press-conference-1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;ammunition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the European Union makes in a year; a production advantage enabled by sanctions-evasion networks spanning three continents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Evasion of Western restrictions has helped Russia ramp up production of certain military equipment and munitions, such as cruise and ballistic missiles, to a greater degree than Western governments initially expected,” John Hardie, Deputy Director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Turkey-UAE-China Triangle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three countries have emerged as critical nodes in Russia’s procurement network. Over the past year, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and China continued to dominate Russia’s sanctions evasion infrastructure, collectively&lt;a href=&quot;https://hir.harvard.edu/fortune-hunting-russia-and-sanctions-evasion/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;accounting for&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 86.2 percent of total battlefield goods shipments and 78.6 percent of critical components shipments to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trade patterns reveal how entrenched these channels have become, and how enforcement efforts under the Trump administration have&lt;a href=&quot;https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10342/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;largely stalled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the first nine months of his administration, President Trump imposed no new sanctions on Russia and declined to join the UK, EU, and other allies in targeting Russian evasion networks. Only in October 2025, after canceling peace talks with Putin, did the Trump team&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cov.com/en/news-and-insights/insights/2025/08/trump-administration-imposes-secondary-tariffs-on-india&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;impose&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; its first direct sanctions on Russia, targeting oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil while threatening secondary sanctions primarily against India, despite China being the largest importer of Russian oil globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“China is by far the most important enabler of that evasion,” Hardie explained. “China serves as both a direct supplier of critical inputs — such as CNC machines, microelectronics, and nitrocellulose — as well as a jurisdiction for Russian illicit procurement of Western products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;China remains the dominant supplier, accounting for&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uscc.gov/research/chinas-facilitation-sanctions-and-export-control-evasion&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;up to 90 percent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Russia’s microelectronics imports. By August last year, Beijing exported a record 328,000 miles of fiber-optic cable and nearly $50 million worth of lithium-ion batteries to Moscow in a single month. According to Germany’s Foreign Ministry, up to&lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2025/11/china-is-the-weak-link-in-europes-ukraine-strategy?lang=en&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;80 percent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Russia’s sanctions circumvention now involves Chinese entities. Russia is paying the price for this dependence: Chinese suppliers&lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2025/11/29/russia-economy-china-trade-markup-sanctioned-goods-ukraine-putin/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;charged Russia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an 87 percent markup on sanctioned goods between 2021 and 2024, compared to just 9 percent from other suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the UAE has become the primary transshipment hub, with electronic component exports to Russia growing more than fifteenfold since the invasion. Dubai-based companies supply everything from aviation parts to Starlink terminals, which Russian forces&lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/2024/03/11/why-russia-has-been-so-resilient-to-western-export-controls-pub-91894&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;buy for around $2,200&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; each. By mid-2024, UAE imports of EU airplane parts hit 23.6 million euros — a&lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/09/russia-eu-sanctions-trade?lang=en&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;fifteenfold jump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — while Turkey’s climbed by a third to 12.7 million euros, even as Russia’s direct purchases fell to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central Asia’s Shell Company Explosion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central Asian states have become essential transit corridors, with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan serving as primary hubs. Throughout 2025, these channels have&lt;a href=&quot;https://lansinginstitute.org/2025/12/01/kazakhstans-expanding-role-in-russias-sanctions-evasion-architecture/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;grown more sophisticated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rather than diminished. From 2021 to 2022, Kyrgyzstan’s exports to Russia exploded by 250 percent, with machinery exports to Russia&lt;a href=&quot;https://thediplomat.com/2025/06/china-kyrgyzstan-and-the-quiet-construction-of-a-sanctions-resistant-trade-corridor/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;spiking&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by 41,000 percent — a figure that “cannot be attributed to market demand” but represents “economic statecraft hidden in plain sight,” according to analysis published in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian buyers keep setting up shell companies in Kazakhstan to purchase electronics and drones from Europe, China, and the United States, then ship them home to Russia’s defense industry. Throughout 2025, Kazakhstan&lt;a href=&quot;https://lansinginstitute.org/2025/12/01/kazakhstans-expanding-role-in-russias-sanctions-evasion-architecture/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;became&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; one of Moscow’s primary backdoors for sanctioned goods. Moreover, Russian marketplace OZON has invested significantly in logistics infrastructure across Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Armenia to consolidate parallel-import cargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diversions are obvious. Landlocked Kyrgyzstan&lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/09/russia-eu-sanctions-trade?lang=en&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;continues&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; importing EU maritime navigation equipment with no plausible domestic use — equipment destined for Russian naval systems. Over the course of last year, Western authorities intensified enforcement. In June, the UK&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/uk-warns-businesses-in-georgia-armenia-kazakhstan-uzbekistan-kyrgyzstan-aiding-russia-evade-sanctions-will-be-sanctioned-themselves/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;warned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; businesses in five countries that those aiding sanctions evasion would face sanctions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, the EU’s 19th sanctions package&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.matheson.com/insights/the-european-unions-19th-sanctions-package-against-russia-key-takeaways/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;targeted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; eight financial institutions in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, the UAE, and Hong Kong for facilitating circumvention, while four banks in Belarus and Kazakhstan were designated for using Russian payment infrastructures. In January 2025, the UK published enhanced&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d6303d4b-469e-4c5b-9c53-3566391ff873&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;guidance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; identifying 15 high-risk countries, including Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, the UAE, and Turkey, for which exporters must conduct enhanced due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how difficult it is to distinguish legitimate trade from sanctions evasion in Central Asia, Ambassador Daniel Fried, a forty-year career diplomat and Distinguished Fellow at the Atlantic Council, acknowledged the complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Such action is labor-intensive but worth the effort,” he tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “We should go after the most impactful technologies and targets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Yuan Lifeline: Russia’s Financial Engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan props up Moscow’s parallel financial system. As of November 2025, 99.1 percent of Russia-China trade settles in rubles and yuan — up from less than 2 percent before the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When&lt;a href=&quot;https://politicstoday.org/russia-and-china-settle-99-of-trade-in-national-currencies/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;major&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Chinese banks like Ping An and Bank of Ningbo stopped accepting Russian payments in mid-2024, smaller regional banks stepped in to fill the gap. These “burner banks” can shut down and reopen under new names if sanctioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workaround was part of a broader effort to rewire Russia’s financial system away from the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of Western currencies in Russian trade&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2025/number/2/article/china-russia-cooperation-economic-linkages-and-sanctions-evasion.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;decreased&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 87 percent to 18 percent between January 2022 and December 2024. Yuan and ruble filled the gap, eliminating Western oversight from the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today.

Beijing became the anchor buyer for Moscow’s hydrocarbons, with crude oil shipments exceeding&lt;a href=&quot;https://merics.org/en/china-russia-dashboard-facts-and-figures-special-relationship&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;108 million tonnes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 — a 30 percent increase since 2022. The Power of Siberia pipeline is reaching full capacity of 38 billion cubic meters annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China-Russia bilateral trade&lt;a href=&quot;https://merics.org/en/china-russia-dashboard-facts-and-figures-special-relationship&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;hit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; $245 billion in 2024, more than double 2020 levels, with 99.1 percent now&lt;a href=&quot;https://politicstoday.org/russia-and-china-settle-99-of-trade-in-national-currencies/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;settled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in yuan and rubles as of late 2024, creating a sanctions-resistant corridor completely insulated from dollar oversight. Though trade dipped slightly in early 2025 — Russian officials projected&lt;a href=&quot;https://russiaspivottoasia.com/russia-china-2025-bilateral-trade-to-exceed-us220-billion/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;around&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; $220 billion for the year due to market adjustments — the financial architecture remains entrenched, with the yuan accounting for&lt;a href=&quot;https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/going-steady-china-and-russias-economic-ties-are-deeper-than-washington-thinks/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;99.8 percent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Moscow Exchange foreign currency trading after summer 2024 U.S. sanctions targeted the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Enforcement Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are structural limitations to Western enforcement. The EU&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epc.eu/publication/sanctions-at-a-crossroads-developing-eu-leadership-amid-an-uncertain-transatlantic-alliance/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;lacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the capacity to check each and every export to a third country. Washington’s secondary sanctions strategy aims to catch violators, but effectiveness is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fried suggested targeted measures to disrupt these supply chains. Western enforcement faces structural limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Targeted sanctions and penalties from the Commerce Department,” he noted. “These are labor-intensive and only partially successful at best, but partial success can have an impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The January 2025 sanctions&lt;a href=&quot;https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2761&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;package&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; targeted nearly 400 entities across more than 20 jurisdictions. Throughout 2024,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/sanctions-by-the-numbers-2024-year-in-review&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;70 percent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. designations were Russia-related, with almost 33 percent targeting entities outside Russia — China accounting for 36 percent of third-country designations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not to say Western sanctions and export controls are useless,” Hardie underscored. “They do make life harder and more expensive for the Russian defense industry. And they have a greater effect on products with obvious military uses, e.g., radiation-hardened “hips for satellites. Sanctions also hamper Russian defense exports, which are an important source of revenue for the Russian defense industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese compliance is particularly complex. Beijing publicly respects Western sanctions yet operates on a principle of “everything not banned is allowed.” Smaller Chinese companies and regional banks keep supplying Russia while staying just within the letter of Chinese law. Beijing tolerates the arrangement as long as it doesn’t constitute a technical violation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

Russia has expanded its defense industry despite sweeping sanctions, leveraging enforcement gaps, asymmetries in global trade, and non-Western intermediaries that facilitate transactions for profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, analysts warn that structural strains are increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there is evidence for both trends, the stresses on the Russian economy are becoming larger,” Fried noted. “The Soviet experience is instructive; the USSR managed to continue its priority programs through the end, but the overall economy deteriorated little by little, and then all at once.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these gaps to be closed, secondary sanctions risk must be dramatically increased, import quotas must be imposed on third countries, or Russia must be granted access to critical technology at a higher cost and with greater complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardie, however, warned against relaxing pressure at a critical moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you need leverage to get Moscow to accept a peace deal, that’s hardly a smart time to make life easier for the Russian war machine,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The moral horror of ICE and Border Patrol agents executing US citizen observers is enough to denounce the Trump administration’s campaign of cruelty in Minnesota. But it is also important to recognize how it reflects the political logic of turning an entire country into a lawless border zone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>They're Coming for Our Kids: How Extremists Target Children Online</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/they-re-coming-for-our-kids</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;  September is National Preparedness Month - when we check our emergency kits, review evacuation routes, and prepare for natural disasters. But this year, as I sat in conference rooms at the Eradicate Hate Global Summit in Pittsburgh, I couldn't stop thinking about a different kind of storm brewing in our communities. One that doesn't announce itself with weather alerts or sirens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It targets our children in their digital third spaces - Discord servers where they chat with friends, Instagram feeds where they scroll for hours, Reddit forums where they seek community, gaming platforms where they unwind, and the sprawling ecosystem of social media where teenagers spend most of their waking hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, teenagers accounted for up to two-thirds of ISIS-linked arrests in Europe, with children as young as 11 involved in recent terrorist plots. But Islamic extremists aren't the only ones hunting in these digital spaces. White supremacist groups, neo-Nazi organizations, and other far-right movements have turned every corner of the internet where young people gather into potential recruitment centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What unites these predators across the ideological spectrum isn't their beliefs - it's their understanding that vulnerable children make easy targets. And while they've perfected their hunting techniques, we've dismantled our defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department issued a call for proposals in July 2025 to fund programs preventing terrorists from recruiting young people online. One month later, they canceled the entire initiative due to funding cuts. The very expertise needed to design and manage such responses had been dismantled when my office - the Office of Countering Violent Extremism - was shuttered along with similar prevention teams across the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're watching the storm approach, and we're sending the meteorologists home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New Hunting Grounds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every platform where teenagers gather has become a recruitment center for extremist movements. Neo-Nazi groups use gaming chats to spread white supremacist messaging. Islamic extremists exploit social media algorithms to target vulnerable youth. Far-right militias recruit through conspiracy theory forums. Anti-government extremists find followers in survivalist communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tactics mirror those used by online predators - build trust, isolate targets, gradually introduce radical ideas, and exploit vulnerabilities. A teenager struggling with social isolation logs into Discord seeking connection and community. Instead, they find recruiters who validate their frustrations while slowly introducing conspiracy theories, hate-filled content, and calls for violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The progression is methodical. First comes the meme that seems edgy but harmless. Then the private message offering &quot;real truth&quot; about current events. Next, the invitation to a smaller, more exclusive group where radical content flows freely. Finally, the encouragement to take action—whether spreading propaganda, targeting individuals, or planning violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren't random encounters. Extremist recruiters study adolescent psychology, identifying kids who show signs of depression, social anxiety, or family conflict. They understand that teenagers are naturally questioning authority and seeking identity—normal developmental phases that can be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History's Warning Signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exploitation of youth isn't new - only the technology has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hitler Youth movement systematically recruited children through youth organizations. The Red Army Faction in 1970s Germany drew from disaffected university students. The Irish Republican Army found fertile recruiting ground among marginalized teenagers in Belfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these historical cases teach us is that extremist movements succeed when they fill voids left by failing institutions. When young people can't find meaning, purpose, or belonging through legitimate channels, they become vulnerable to those offering simple explanations for complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's digital environment amplifies these vulnerabilities exponentially. Where previous extremists recruited face-to-face in specific locations, online recruiters can reach millions simultaneously, test messaging in real-time, and operate across borders with minimal detection risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Programs We Dismantled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevention infrastructure dismantled over the past year wasn't theoretical—it was saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the State Department, our team worked with tech companies to identify recruitment tactics and develop content policies that protected legitimate speech while removing extremist material. We helped content moderators recognize subtle grooming techniques that avoid automated detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships at DHS built relationships with schools and community organizations to identify early warning signs. Their approach was therapeutic, not punitive—providing intervention resources that addressed underlying issues rather than criminalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the FBI, specialized teams tracked recruitment networks and distinguished between teenage edginess and genuine threats. The Department of Health and Human Services funded research into psychological vulnerabilities that informed prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All shared common principles: early intervention beats prosecution; community solutions work better than federal enforcement; understanding radicalization psychology is essential for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Disinformation Amplifier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes today's threat environment particularly dangerous is how disinformation amplifies extremist recruitment while major platforms fail to enforce their own policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I write this, Houthi-linked arms dealers openly sell weapons on verified X accounts, advertising Kalashnikovs and equipment marked &quot;Property of U.S. Govt.&quot; The Tech Transparency Project identified 130 Yemen-based accounts advertising weapons, some with verification checkmarks. X even ran advertisements beneath these posts, generating revenue from terrorist-linked content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A teenager exposed to election fraud conspiracies becomes more susceptible to political violence messaging. Young people fed disinformation about minority communities become easier targets for white supremacist recruitment. Disinformation serves as a gateway drug to radicalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

When she sought help, local resources that might have provided intervention had lost federal funding. A police officer described investigating a high school attack plot that might have been prevented if early warning systems remained operational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These costs are measured in broken families, traumatized communities, and young lives destroyed by preventable radicalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Preparedness Really Means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't wait for hurricanes before planning—we build early warning systems and maintain emergency capabilities. The same logic should apply to extremist recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need systems detecting concerning behavioral changes before they become threats. We need intervention addressing psychological vulnerabilities before recruiters exploit them. We need community responses providing support when families encounter these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news: we know what works. Community-based prevention programs have demonstrated success in interrupting radicalization. EXIT programs in Germany and Sweden help individuals leave extremist groups through mentorship and psychological support. The Against Violent Extremism network connects former extremists with at-risk youth. Montreal's Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence has successfully intervened in over 1,000 cases through family counseling and community partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Path Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding prevention infrastructure requires immediate action and long-term commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress must restore funding for prevention programs at State, DHS, FBI, and HHS. These aren't luxury programs—they're essential public safety capabilities protecting vulnerable citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must rebuild scattered expertise by bringing prevention professionals back from think tanks, universities, and private companies through sustained investment commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need stronger partnerships between agencies, tech companies, schools, and communities. Prevention works best at multiple levels simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents and educators need training to recognize early warning signs. This means providing basic digital literacy and threat awareness to identify concerning behavioral changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need counter-messaging strategies competing with extremist propaganda for young people's attention—empowering communities to tell better stories about identity, purpose, and belonging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Field Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention vs. Reaction:&lt;/strong&gt; Preventing one radicalized individual costs approximately $30,000. Investigating, prosecuting, and incarcerating them after violence costs over $3 million—not counting human costs to victims and communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; The most effective programs work through trusted institutions—schools, religious organizations, sports teams, youth groups. Federal resources can support but can't replace local relationships and trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reader Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Your Circle:&lt;/strong&gt; Talk with young people about their online experiences—not to interrogate, but to understand their digital worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Local Programs:&lt;/strong&gt; Find prevention resources in your community. School counselors and youth organizations often spot concerning trends before law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice Digital Hygiene:&lt;/strong&gt; Model good information consumption. Fact-check claims before sharing them. Ask questions about sources when your teen shows you &quot;shocking&quot; content. Demonstrate critical thinking by saying &quot;That sounds concerning—let's look up where this information comes from&quot; rather than immediately reacting emotionally. Young people learn more from observation than instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I flew home from Pittsburgh, I thought about my children and their digital world. The threats they face aren't visible from satellites or predictable through models. They emerge from the intersection of human psychology and technology in ways we're only beginning to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But September's preparedness lessons still apply: early warning, community response, and sustained vigilance. The storms targeting our children won't announce themselves with sirens, but they can be detected, understood, and prevented—if we're willing to invest in the tools and expertise necessary to protect what matters most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cipher Brief Expert Dexter Ingram also publishes on Substack &lt;a href=&quot;https://dexteringram.substack.com/p/ive-tracked-terrorist-networks-for?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Code Name: Citizen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/dec/23/pope-leos-world-day-peace-opportunity-put-words-action/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Next FATF Test: Can the West Demand Results from Pakistan?</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-next-fatf-test-can-the-west-demand-results-from-pakistan</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;In the shadow of Mexico City's historic Palacio de Bellas Artes, global financial watchdogs will convene in February 2026 for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Plenary and Working Group Meetings. In conference rooms far removed from South Asia’s violence, Pakistan will once again present itself as a responsible counterterrorism partner, armed with compliance reports, legislative amendments, and assurances of reform. On paper, Pakistan’s financial regulations increasingly resemble those of many developing democracies. On the ground, however, the networks that finance and enable terrorism continue to adapt and operate with troubling resilience. The widening gap between form and function is precisely what Western policymakers must confront as FATF prepares its next round of assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Compliance Illusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s removal from the FATF grey list in 2022 was widely portrayed as a&lt;a href=&quot;https://mofa.gov.pk/pakistan-exits-fatfs-grey-list&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;success story&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Officials pointed to new anti-money laundering laws, terrorist financing prosecutions, and institutional reforms as evidence of a course correction. FATF itself&lt;a href=&quot;http://fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Mutualevaluations/Fur-pakistan-2022.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;acknowledged&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; technical improvements, yet it also emphasized that effectiveness, not legislation, remains the ultimate benchmark. That distinction has proven critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open-source reporting and documented financial intelligence patterns suggest that terrorist organizations such as Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) have not been dismantled but rather modernized.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-pakistan-backed-lashkar-e-taiba-jaish-e-mohammad-s-new-tactics-for-anti-india-activities-exploiting-gaza-war-for-terror-financing-recruiting-3196528&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Recent documents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveal how these UN-designated outfits exploit humanitarian crises, such as the Gaza conflict, to funnel funds into terror activities. Under the guise of aid appeals and mosque reconstructions, figures like Hammad Azhar, son of JeM leader Masood Azhar, and Azhar’s brother Talha al-Saif orchestrate campaigns&lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/pakistan-based-jem-launches-rs-3-91-billion-fundraising-drive-after-losses-during-operation-sindoor/articleshow/123434708.cms?from=mdr&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;using digital wallets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like EasyPaisa, SadaPay, and JazzCash, aggregating micro-donations and cryptocurrencies to evade detection. These efforts aggregate micro-donations and cryptocurrency transfers, often employing fragmented wallet structures and chain-hopping across platforms to avoid detection. Funds have&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/months-after-operation-sindoor-setback-pak-terror-outfit-jaish-raises-funds-to-rebuild-2774256-2025-08-20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;reportedly supported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; militant infrastructure, including the establishment of more than 300 Mosques and the reconstruction of locations historically linked to LeT training facilities damaged during India’s 2025 Operation Sindoor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern reflects more than opportunism. Pakistan’s legal framework may align with FATF’s 40 recommendations on paper, but operational enforcement remains deeply inconsistent. Sanctioned individuals such as Hafiz Talha Saeed have&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/hafiz-saeed-son-talha-saeed-lahore-rally-pm-modi-pahalgam-terror-attack-india-pak-tensions-2720626-2025-05-06&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;led public rallies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Lahore under police protection, issuing threats against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In 2025, senior Pakistani legislature Rana Muhammad Qasim Noon&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/India/pak-rebuilding-muzaffarabad-terror-camp-destroyed-in-operation-sindoor-minister-visits-site/ar-AA1PHdR0?cvid=6908a8eda8264964b07b806b1720fa36&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;reportedly visited&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; militant-affiliated reconstruction sites alongside local officials, revealing overt collaboration between state and non-state actors. Recruitment drives&lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-operation-sindoor-major-pakistan-terror-groups-shifting-base-to-afghanistan-border/articleshow/124008707.cms&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;disguised as religious gatherings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, often coordinated with Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam networks, have featured speeches praising Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, delivered by JeM commander Masood Ilyas Kashmiri at facilities such as Markaz Shohada-e-Islam in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these cases point to a long-standing “management” model of extremism. Militant groups are not dismantled but rebranded, with political fronts such as&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-party-face-of-mumbai-attacks-mastermind-hafiz-saeeds-banned-group-to-participate-in-pakistan-general-election/article67812218.ece&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contesting elections while violence is normalized as a political instrument.

Militant violence has&lt;a href=&quot;https://crss.pk/three-quarters-of-2025-nearly-as-violent-as-entire-2024/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;surged significantly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, driven by attacks from the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan and Baloch insurgent groups. Rather than prompting a clean break with all forms of militancy, this instability risks reinforcing the proxy logic that FATF scrutiny is meant to dismantle. For Western policymakers, the danger lies in conflating cooperation with convergence in security priorities. Intelligence sharing, access agreements, or economic partnerships do not necessarily reflect aligned counterterrorism priorities. As I&lt;a href=&quot;https://millichronicle.com/2025/10/58400.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;argued previously&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Milli Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Pakistan’s strategic incentives continue to reward selective tolerance of militant actors, particularly those oriented toward India. FATF’s effectiveness framework exists to test whether states are willing to disrupt these incentives, not simply mask them with procedural compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FATF’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/comprehensive-update-terrorist-financing-risks-2025.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;2025 Comprehensive Update&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Terrorist Financing Risks underscores the urgency. The report highlights a marked increase in hybrid digital methods, consistent with Pakistan-linked entities shifting from banks to fintech platforms to evade oversight. Although Pakistan exited the grey list in 2022 after four years of economic strain, FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aninews.in/news/world/europe/exit-from-greylist-not-bulletproof-fatf-warns-pakistan-against-terror-financing20251025044030/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;warned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October 2025 that the removal was “not bulletproof,” citing unregulated digital transactions as a continuing vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico City should therefore serve as a turning point. US and EU delegations should press for outcome-based evaluations focused on sustained investigations, verifiable asset seizures, and the dismantling of facilitation networks. Particular scrutiny must be directed toward digital payment systems, informal charities, and micro-donation models that exploit regulatory blind spots. Western governments should also coordinate more closely to monitor cross-border flows linked to high-risk jurisdictions, ensuring that Pakistan’s reforms translate into measurable disruption rather than rhetorical reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: Choosing Substance Over Stability Theater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will argue that renewed scrutiny risks destabilizing a fragile state. That argument has been persuasive before, and it has failed before. Stability built on tolerated militancy is not stability at all; it is deferred risk. Western capitals should therefore anchor their engagement around two imperatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, international partners should move beyond accepting legislative reforms and instead condition high-level diplomatic, security, and economic engagement with Pakistan on verifiable enforcement outcomes. This means tying cooperation to demonstrable actions such as sustained terrorist-financing prosecutions, asset freezes against UN- and US-designated individuals, and the disruption of digital fundraising networks linked to groups like JeM and LeT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, Washington and Brussels should treat Pakistan-linked terrorist financing as a transnational financial integrity threat, not a regional security issue. This requires enhanced monitoring of fintech platforms, mobile wallets, charities, and micro-donation systems used by diaspora-linked networks in Europe and North America. FATF has repeatedly warned that terrorist groups increasingly exploit digital payments and new financial technologies to evade traditional controls. The EU and US should expand joint typology sharing, require higher due-diligence thresholds for transactions linked to high-risk jurisdictions, and protect activists and journalists targeted by&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/repression-without-borders-how-pakistan-silences-critics-overseas/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;transnational repression&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tied to Pakistan’s security apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Mexico City, Pakistan will speak in the language of compliance and reform. Beyond the conference halls, the true test will be whether the networks that finance violence are finally dismantled or quietly allowed to endure. If Western governments choose substance over symbolism, this moment can mark a turning point. If not, the paperwork will pass, and the risks will return—more adaptive, more opaque, and more dangerous than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>Russia is Targeting Civilians in Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-is-targeting-civilians-in-ukraine</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine &lt;a href=&quot;https://ukraine.ohchr.org/en/2025-deadliest-year-for-civilians-in-Ukraine-since-2022-UN-human-rights-monitors-find&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that 14,383 civilians were killed in Ukraine, 673 of them children, as of late 2025. Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine’s power grid, generating facilities, and heating infrastructure, in efforts to disrupt electricity, heat, and water services – especially in winter. Clearly, Russia is targeting Ukraine’s civilian population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, recently told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kyiv-has-only-half-electricity-it-needs-mayor-says-2026-01-16/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reuters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Kyiv, with a population of 3.6 million people, has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis, following waves of Russian attacks on its infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth year, Ukrainian casualties are estimated at around 400,000, with civilian casualties rising, according to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Laws of War are clear: intentionally targeting civilians is prohibited; civilians should never be the objective of an attack.

These attacks are not isolated to the Kyiv, but, rather, part of a large, coordinated plan to target all regions in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has reported tens of thousands of energy infrastructure facilities have been damaged since 2022, damaging generation plants, substations, heating plants, and transmission lines. And at least 18 major combined heat and power plants have been destroyed or seriously damaged, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian strikes have left hundreds of thousands of people with no central heating during sub-zero weather, a widespread development throughout Ukraine. Indeed, officials and humanitarian groups are warning that millions of Ukrainians are at heightened risk this winter due to lack of heat, electricity, and water amid the intense cold. UN officials described the situation as a worsening humanitarian crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has systematically targeted civilian energy and heating infrastructure, not just military sites, with repeated missile and drone strikes aimed at power plants, grids, and heating systems, affecting thousands of facilities. The result is widespread blackouts and heating loss for civilians, especially during harsh &lt;a href=&quot;https://united24media.com/war-in-ukraine/weaponizing-winter-the-unrelenting-toll-of-russian-energy-strikes-on-kyivs-civilians-continues-15205&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;winter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with sub-zero temperatures, creating a serious humanitarian situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Putin’s strategy is to target civilians with the intensification of bombings against Ukraine’s infrastructure that provides heat, water, and electricity to the Ukrainian people. These are violations of the Laws of War, and the International Criminal Court should immediately commence with hearings on Russia’s indiscriminate bombing of civilian infrastructure, resulting in the death of thousands of Ukrainian civilians. Clearly, Mr. Putin is targeting Ukraine’s civilian population, a war crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph R.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The rise of the West is a simple story to tell culturally: It’s about Europe moving toward openness, cosmopolitanism, intellectual freedom, transparent rules, and, above all, institutional checks and balances.

      <title>Loosening the Gordian Knot of Global Terrorism: Why Legitimacy Must Anchor a Counterterrorism Strategy</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/loosening-the-gordian-knot-of-global-terrorism-why-legitimacy-must-anchor-a-counterterrorism-strategy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; The global terrorism landscape in 2026 — the 25&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;anniversary year of the 9/11 terrorism attacks — is more uncertain, hybridized, and combustible than at any point since 9/11. Framing a sound U.S. counterterrorism strategy — especially in the second year of a Trump administration — will require more than isolated strikes against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/25/us/politics/trump-isis-nigeria-strike.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ISIS in Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, punitive counterterrorism operations in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2025/12/19/g-s1-103194/u-s-launches-strikes-syria&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, or a tougher rhetorical posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Trump administration counterterrorism strategy will require legitimacy: the domestic, international, and legal credibility that leverages a wide-range of counterterrorism tools, while engendering international counterterrorism cooperation. Without legitimacy, even tactically successful counterterrorism operations risk becoming illusory, politicized, and ultimately self-defeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The terrorist threat landscape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extremist violence no longer conforms to clean ideological lines. Terrorist objectives and drivers are muddled in ways that are hard to understand — but evolving. There’s little &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hstoday.us/featured/wray-lone-actors-purity-of-radical-ideology-giving-way-to-weird-hodgepodge-of-beliefs-behind-attacks/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ideological purity&lt;/a&gt; with those radicalizing in today’s extremist milieu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, state-directed intelligence officers increasingly behave like terrorists. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/15/world/europe/uk-mi6-russia-chaos.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Russian intelligence-linked&lt;/a&gt; sabotage plots blur the line between terrorism and hybrid warfare. Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers provide hands-on training to Lebanese Hizballah commanders. Addressing these kinds of risks requires legitimacy, too, especially among allies whose intelligence cooperation, legal authorities, and public support are indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is this threat picture more tenuous than in the Middle East. Hamas’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47828#:~:text=Summary,the%20Gaza%20Strip%20into%20Israel.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;October 7, 2023&lt;/a&gt;, attacks triggered a profound rebalancing of power in the region. Yet, Syria remains unfinished business. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/playing-the-role-of-good-shepherd-in-a-post-assad-syria&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Power vacuums&lt;/a&gt; there invite foreign jihadists, threaten Israel's border communities, and create future opportunities for Iranian influence to rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modest but persistent U.S. presence in Syria with a friendly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/syria-to-join-coalition-against-islamic-state-as-countrys-president-visits-trump-ed16328c&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ahmed al-Sharaa&lt;/a&gt;-led government remains a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/trump-administrations-counterterrorism-policy-should-begin-at-golan-heights&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;strategic hedge&lt;/a&gt; against an Islamic State resurgence, and is a strong signal of U.S. commitment that helps sustain partner confidence. The U.S. counterterrorism presence and alignment with al-Sharaa is not without its risks, though: in December, three Americans were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/world/middleeast/syria-us-soldiers-killed.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by a lone ISIS gunman in central Syria. The country is, and will continue to be, plagued by sectarianism and terrorism, which means that restoring control over a deeply fractured Syria remains fraught. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the current transnational terrorism threat landscape is volatile and difficult to predict, a challenge compounded by resource constraints. In such an environment, legitimacy becomes a force multiplier. A belief that America is a ‘force for good’, credible messaging, and confidence that U.S. government action is perceived as just, can go a long way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not an abstract concern. Terrorism today thrives in contested information environments, polarized societies, and fragile states. In short, transnational jihadist networks now coexist with domestic violent extremists, and online &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/islamic-states-caliphate-is-gone-its-influence-lives-on-7aed6cec&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;radicalization ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; that blur the line between terrorism, insurgency, and hybrid warfare. Terrorist propaganda continues to resonate with individuals in the West, especially younger generations who radicalize online. In this environment, legitimacy is no longer a secondary benefit of sound strategy—it is a core guiding principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trump administration's counterterrorism approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are looking for more clarity on the trajectory of Trump 2.0 counterterrorism efforts. It’s still, premature to consider a strategy that has yet to be formally articulated, as many in the counterterrorism community eagerly await its release. History offers a useful reminder. The first Trump administration did not publish its &lt;a href=&quot;https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NSCT.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Strategy for Counterterrorism&lt;/a&gt; until its second year. When it appeared in 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/10/trump-counterterrorism-strategy/572170/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;critics&lt;/a&gt; and supporters alike acknowledged that it reflected professional judgment rather than ideological excess. That document recognized terrorism’s evolution and called for strengthening counterterrorism partnerships within the U.S. government, but abroad as well, with a range of longstanding allies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What gave that strategy durability was its legitimacy. Authorities were grounded in law, threat assessments were evidence-based, policies were stress-tested for faulty assumptions, and foreign partnerships were treated as strategic assets rather than transactional relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Biden administration publicly released a set of redacted rules secretly issued by President Trump in 2017 for counterterrorism operations — such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/01/us/politics/trump-drone-strike-rules.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“direct action”&lt;/a&gt; strikes and special operations raids outside conventional war zones — those &lt;a href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/trump-psp-drone-strike-rules-foia/52f4a4baf5fc54c5/full.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; explicitly acknowledged the power of legitimacy. Counterterrorism succeeds when allies trust the U.S., and the American public believes force is used proportionately and lawfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That legacy of trust matters now more than ever, given signals that a second Trump administration could overcorrect on its counterterrorism priorities by redirecting and focusing resources on far-left extremist groups such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/us-news/justice-department-charges-four-in-alleged-new-years-eve-bomb-plot-37d38bb3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Turtle Island Liberation Front (TILF)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/18/justice-department-fbi-first-amendment-antifa/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Antifa&lt;/a&gt;, while downplaying far-right extremism—or being distracted from the more dangerous terrorism threats from ISIS and other violent jihadists. As the world recently witnessed during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/isis-syria-bondi-beach-attacks-christmas-11239979&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;holidays&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/31/world/australia/bondi-beach-attack-vigil-new-year-sydney.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bondi Beach&lt;/a&gt; to Syria, ISIS remains a threat. Far-Left terrorism in the U.S. is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/charlie-kirk-left-wing-terrorism/684323/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, but far-right terrorism accounts for greater lethality than did the left. And still, after 25 years, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-december-19/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ISIS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-global-state-of-al-qaida-24-years-after-9-11/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;al-Qa’ida&lt;/a&gt; that remain the most persistent and enduring transnational terrorism threat against U.S interests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trump National Security Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s concerning that the recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (NSS) only tepidly addresses &lt;a href=&quot;https://mwi.westpoint.edu/what-happened-to-transnational-terrorism/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transnational terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, but notably links terrorism with cross-border threats and hemispheric cooperation against things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/inside-trump-s-second-term-national-security-strategy?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“narco-terrorists,”&lt;/a&gt; blurring the traditional separation between transnational organized crime and terrorism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Trump administration’s emphasis on drug cartels is justifiable, if it does &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;detract from broader counterterrorism objectives, such as the ISIS or hybridizing terrorist threats that continue to emerge. Commentators claim, however, that the Trump administration is already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/22/terrorism-antifa-cartels-islamic-state-trump/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzY2NDY2MDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzY3ODQ4Mzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NjY0NjYwMDAsImp0aSI6IjBmZjlhNzVjLTY2ZTMtNGE5Ni1iYTE1LTVhMWI2ZjJhY2Y4ZiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDI1LzEyLzIyL3RlcnJvcmlzbS1hbnRpZmEtY2FydGVscy1pc2xhbWljLXN0YXRlLXRydW1wLyJ9.G3CUd5dUcejxMk6jlx5otj5FfSyAg8z_r0x4xmdUGvk&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;losing sight&lt;/a&gt; of the ISIS and al-Qa’ida threats, though settling that debate here is quixotic at best — only time will tell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides jihadi threats, the U.S. does not need the unintended consequences and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/us-intervention-against-mexican-cartels-carries-major-risks-heres-how-to-mitigate-them/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt; of triggering a cycle of cartel retaliation – or &lt;a href=&quot;https://icct.nl/publication/counter-terrorism-implications-second-trump-presidency&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;provoking greater far-left violence&lt;/a&gt; – down-the-line in the U.S. homeland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrastingly, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2017 National Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt; saw radical Islamist terrorism as one of the priority transnational threats that could undermine U.S. security and stability. The strategy highlighted groups such as ISIS and al-Qa’ida as continuing dangers, stressing that terrorists had taken control of parts of the Middle East and remained a threat globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

It also erodes trust between the government and the public and leads citizens to second-guess whether they are being told the truth or being led astray. The 2017 NSS carried weight precisely because it was grounded in intelligence, not politics. Moreover, the NSS helped frame the counterterrorism strategy that followed and proved highly effective in keeping Americans safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawing lessons from the 2018 National Strategy for Counterterrorism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3466967&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2018 National Strategy for Counterterrorism (NSCT)&lt;/a&gt; remains a useful foundation for the second Trump administration—not because the world is unchanged, but because it embraced balance. The strategy emphasized foreign partnerships, non-military tools, and targeted direct action when necessary. It recognized a central legitimacy principle: the United States cannot and should not fight every terrorist everywhere with American troops when capable counterterrorism partners can do so in their own backyards, with local consent, and a more granular understanding of the grievances that motivate these terrorist groups and their supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And still, U.S. counterterrorism pressure through direct action remains a necessary tool to disrupt terrorism planning. It seems that the second Trump Administration is following the playbook of the first Trump administration in terms of aggressive counterterrorism kinetic strikes in places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/trump-airstrikes-isis-somalia.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/us-attack-houthis.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yemen,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/14/middleeast/iraq-syria-isis-killed-intl-hnk/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/counterterrorism-drone-strikes.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rescinded Biden-era limits on counterterrorism drone strikes&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the kind of flexible operational framework used for counterterrorism throughout the President’s first term. Thus far, in the aggressive counter-narcotic campaign in international waters off Venezuela, the standoff U.S. strikes resemble &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/12/18/stephen-miller-boat-strikes-mexico-venezuela-execute-order/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;counterterrorism operations&lt;/a&gt; in Yemen and Somalia during the first Trump administration. Operationally, direct action remains an indispensable counterterrorism tool for disrupting terror groups overseas, and more U.S. direct action will likely be necessary in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/world/africa/africa-terrorism-trump-ivory-coast.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;West Africa and the Sahel&lt;/a&gt; to keep jihadist groups operating there off balance, forcing them to devote more time and resources to operational security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But pressure without legitimacy is counterproductive. What works against jihadist networks does not necessarily translate cleanly to drug cartels or transnational criminal gangs. So, policymakers must be circumspect that expanding the scope of counterterrorism authorities and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justsecurity.org/107770/cartels-foreign-terrorism-designation/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;terrorist designations&lt;/a&gt; to canvas drug cartels, risks the unintended consequences of triggering destabilizing cycles of violence in the future, and straining more traditional counterterrorism resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming full circle, in light of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/us/politics/trump-capture-maduro-venezuela.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro&lt;/a&gt; for narcoterrorism-related offenses, the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/opinion/venezuela-attack-trump-us.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;legitimacy&lt;/a&gt; will be fiercely debated in the days and weeks ahead. If the Trump National Security Strategy is the roadmap for focusing on narcoterrorism in the Western Hemisphere, then the need for publishing a clarifying and rational U.S. counterterrorism strategy for the rest of the world takes on even greater sense of urgency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing a boulder uphill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on past counterterrorism lessons to find a comprehensive strategy—from the Bush administration’s wartime footing, through 8 years of Obama counterterrorism work, to President Trump’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/26557430.pdf?refreqid=fastly-default%3A1faeef863e0ec72ac7818cd224ce47cf&amp;amp;ab_segments=&amp;amp;initiator=&amp;amp;acceptTC=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;war on terror&quot;&lt;/a&gt; — is a Sisyphean task. But, in the wake of over two decades of relentless overseas counterterrorism work, a few ideas have come into sharper focus:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After more than two decades of counterterrorism, loosening the Gordian knot of modern terrorism requires balance, far greater clarity, and consistent, predictable national leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, counterterrorism strategy requires legitimacy. Without it, counterterrorism becomes reactive and politicized. With it, a Trump 2.0 counterterrorism strategy can still be firm, flexible, and credible in a far more dangerous world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>Iran at the Breaking Point: How Afghanistan and Iraq Still Inform U.S. Strategy</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/iran-at-the-breaking-point-how-afghanistan-and-iraq-still-inform-u-s-strategy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT PERSPECTIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;Iran is experiencing its most consequential period of internal &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/toll-irans-protest-crackdown-reaches-5002-dead-trump-129476717&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;unrest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in years. Nationwide demonstrations driven by economic collapse, social grievance, and political frustration have been met with force, mass arrests, and near-total information control. The scale and coordination of the response suggest a regime that feels threatened but not unmoored, confident in its ability to absorb pressure while preventing fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This moment has reignited debate in Washington about escalation, leverage, and the possibility—explicit or implicit—of regime collapse. That debate is familiar. The United States has confronted similar moments before, most notably in Afghanistan and Iraq, where early assumptions about pressure, legitimacy, and endurance proved wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is not an argument for restraint or intervention. It is a warning drawn from experience: without understanding how competition unfolds below the level of open conflict - the gray zone - pressure alone does not produce favorable outcomes. Iran today sits at the center of a problem the United States has repeatedly misunderstood - not the use of force, but what comes before and after it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afghanistan and Iraq: Where Strategy Slipped&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan, the United States removed the Taliban from power quickly. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein’s regime collapsed even faster. In both cases, the decisive phase of the conflict ended early. What followed was the harder contest—one defined less by firepower and more by local power structures, informal authority, and external interference operating quietly and persistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan, as I witnessed firsthand, regional actors adapted faster than Washington. Iran, Pakistan, Russia, and later China treated the conflict as a long game. They invested in relationships, cultivated influence, and positioned themselves for the post-U.S. environment years before the withdrawal. The result was not an immediate defeat on the battlefield, but a strategic hollowing-out of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq followed a similar trajectory. Iranian-aligned militias embedded themselves within neighborhoods, religious institutions, and political parties. Over time, they became inseparable from the state itself. U.S. military dominance did not prevent this. In fact, it often obscured it, until the architecture of influence was already in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson from both cases is straightforward: control of territory is temporary; control of networks endures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iran Is Not Afghanistan or Iraq — But the Pattern Rhymes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran today is often discussed as if pressure will produce rapid political change. That assumption ignores how power is organized inside the Islamic Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran’s security model is deliberately social. The Basij is not simply a paramilitary &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/6238623/iran-basij-militia-meaning-mahsa-amini/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;force&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; it is embedded across society—universities, workplaces, neighborhoods, religious institutions. Its purpose is not only repression, but surveillance, mobilization, and ideological reinforcement. This structure was built to survive unrest, sanctions, and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Externally, Iran has exported the same logic. In Iraq, allied militias function simultaneously as armed actors, political movements, and social providers. In Afghanistan, Iran preserved influence across regime changes, maintaining access to key actors even after the fall of the Republic. These are not improvisations; they are the product of decades of learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth remembering that Iran was not a spectator during the U.S. presence in Afghanistan and Iraq. It observed American methods up close—what worked, what failed, and where patience outperformed power. Tehran adapted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Escalation Without Preparation Backfires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moments of internal unrest often create pressure for external action. Yet Afghanistan and Iraq show that collapse—real or perceived—creates its own risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing a regime does not dismantle informal power structures. It often accelerates their consolidation. Networks that survive pressure are the ones that define what comes next. Iran’s internal system is designed precisely for this kind of stress: decentralized, redundant, and socially embedded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a strategic paradox at play. External pressure can validate internal narratives of siege and foreign threat, strengthening coercive institutions rather than weakening them. Information controls, security mobilization, and proxy signaling are not reactions; they are rehearsed responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why simplistic comparisons—whether to Eastern Europe, Latin America, or past protest movements, are misleading. Iran’s political &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/iran-crumbling-revolutionary-facade-protests&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ecosystem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is closer to the environments the United States faced in Kabul and Baghdad than many in Washington are willing to admit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who’s Reading this? More than 500K of the most influential national security experts in the world. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;full access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; to what the Experts are reading?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this suggests that Iran is immune to pressure or that its current trajectory is stable. Economic distress, generational change, and legitimacy erosion are real. But history cautions against assuming that pressure equals control or that unrest equals opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more relevant question for U.S. policymakers is not whether Iran is vulnerable, but whether the United States is prepared to operate effectively in the space that follows vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That preparation requires understanding how authority is distributed beneath formal institutions, recognizing how coercive and social systems reinforce one another, and anticipating how regional actors adapt during periods of instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the same lessons Afghanistan and Iraq offered lessons learned too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran’s current unrest has reopened a familiar debate in Washington about pressure, leverage, and escalation. But Afghanistan and Iraq should have settled that debate long ago. The United States did not lose those conflicts because it lacked military power; it lost because it underestimated how authority, loyalty, and influence actually function inside contested societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran is not a blank slate, nor is it a fragile state waiting to collapse under external strain. It is a system built to absorb pressure, manage unrest, and outlast moments of crisis. Any approach that treats unrest as an opportunity without first understanding what follows it risks repeating the same strategic error the United States has already made—twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choice facing U.S. policymakers is therefore not whether to act, but how to act without misunderstanding the terrain. Escalation without preparation does not produce control; it produces consequences that others are better positioned to manage. If Washington has truly learned from Afghanistan and Iraq, it will recognize that the most dangerous moment is not the collapse of order, but the false confidence that comes before it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History will not judge the United States on whether it applied pressure. It will judge whether it understood what that pressure would unleash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-kremlin-files-russias-way-to-the-gray-zone</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/two-men-in-a-serious-conversation-one-in-a-suit-the-other-in-a-military-uniform.jpg?id=63002583&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C44%2C0%2C44&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE KREMLIN FILES / COLUMN — &lt;/strong&gt;(Note: This is the first in a two-part &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-surveillance-state&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;series&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Russian gray zone, or hybrid warfare. In a future article, the author will address the continued evolution of Russian hybrid warfare and its practice in the years immediately leading up to and through Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian hybrid warfare, often referred to in the West as “gray zone” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/gray-zone-warfare&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conflict&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has transitioned from theoretical concept to prominent headlines, particularly following the invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin’s campaigns of sabotage, disinformation, and targeted intelligence actions across Europe and the U.S. What defines Russian-style gray warfare, or hybrid war? What are its doctrinal roots, and how well do these foundations align with assumptions in Western security discussions? To explore these questions, this article analyzes the writings of Russian military thinkers and the views of Russian military and intelligence agencies—covering their terminology, doctrines, and their evolving grasp of non-kinetic conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray zone operations in the West are generally seen as actions that influence the course of a conflict or harm an adversary without crossing into direct kinetic attacks. For Russia, at the core of the gray zone is the concept of “non-contact war” (&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;bezkontaktnaya voina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), which is part of a larger doctrinal framework under which gray warfare, also called “new generation warfare” by the Russians, falls. This is not a new concept in Russian military thinking, but it has developed over decades. By examining its evolution over the past thirty years through Russian sources and military thinkers, we can better understand how Moscow uses these concepts today—and how they influence the conflicts we may face now and in the future, enabling the U.S. and our allies to respond more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main components of Russian gray warfare. Russians rarely use the term hybrid war, which exists in Russian only as a borrowed term from English. The first concept is non-contact warfare—the concept of preparing and softening the battlefield, then minimizing ground engagements for their troops whenever possible. The second concept is Russian intelligence active measures, also known as measures of support. This is also an old idea in Russian intelligence circles, but one that has been expanded and intensified in recent decades, incorporating new elements such as cyber operations and cognitive warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will briefly discuss each of these concepts below, along with Russia’s gray-zone developments up to its deployments into Ukraine in 2014. In the second part of this series, we will analyze Russia’s doctrine as it was applied in the years immediately leading up to and through the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while also considering another key factor for Russia—their ability to evolve and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Contact Warfare: Origins and Russian Military Necessities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-contact warfare developed from what the Russian General Staff and other military thinkers called sixth-generation warfare. The concept grew from the “reconnaissance strike complex” theory and the so-called “revolution in military affairs” at the end of the Cold War. As the Soviet Union disintegrated and the U.S. demonstrated overwhelming air power with NATO and other allies during the Persian Gulf war, former Soviet and Russian generals were not fools. They understood they could not keep pace with the new advancements in air warfare and the technological edge of NATO weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian General Staff thinkers recognized that the Russian Air Force could not match TTPs (techniques, tactics, and procedures), the number of pilot training hours, or the advanced systems that the U.S. and NATO could field, especially given their significantly reduced military budget following the Soviet Union's collapse. This operational shortfall was further emphasized by the targeted bombing campaigns and overwhelming force deployed by U.S./NATO forces in the Balkan campaigns of the mid-1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

NATO airpower and the reach of the alliance into all sorts of regions and conflict zones posed a significant challenge for the Russian military and its intelligence services. One of the lessons they understood was that massed tank formations alone would not win wars in the 21st century. Throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s, several important writings were produced by prominent Russian general staff figures, such as Generals Slipchenko and Gareev, as well as the future Chief of Staff of the Russian military and currently the commander of the Russian forces in the Ukraine war, Valeriy Gerasimov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slipchenko is credited in Russia with coining the phrase “sixth generation warfare” more than twenty years ago. According to Slipchenko, this new form of warfare signified a shift from nuclear-based conflict (which he called “fifth generation”) toward information-enabled, precision-strike, so-called non-contact wars (he authored a book with that same title). These wars would be fought at a distance, relying on airpower, command, control, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (C4ISR), and long-range precision strikes, rather than large ground forces. He and Gareev published a book in Russia in 2004 titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Future Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which became influential in many Russian military circles. In this work, Slipchenko and Gareev emphasized the importance of studying non-contact warfare and firmly stated that Russia must adapt to it, or else “Russia would not survive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that same period, Russia’s Air Force struggled significantly in the 1990s and 2000s to adopt precision-guided munitions (PGMs). Russia never fully integrated them or appropriately trained them on their use, which was evident in its prolonged conflicts with Chechen separatists. Most ground-attack operations during that period, from the mid to late 1990s, relied on “dumb bombs” and massed artillery on the battlefield. This resulted in the Russian air force’s poor performance in the 2008 Georgian conflict, when an outmanned Georgian military embarrassingly shot down several Russian fighter-bombers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2008, responding to Georgia launching an incursion to retake South Ossetia, Russia responded with overwhelming force, sending an entire army to occupy swaths of Abkhazia, Ossetia, and also northern Georgia from Poti to Gori and the edges of Tbilisi. But while their force ratios led to quick success on the ground, the Russian air force did not perform as well in the air. In addition to air losses to ground-based air defense and friendly fire, Russian precision strikes did not go off as planned. Russia’s performance could be summed up as ineffective from the air. They were not able to project over-the-horizon warfare in the ways that Russian military planners had envisioned for non-contact war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first widespread and successful use of Russian PGMs would come still later, mostly during Russia’s involvement in Syria, where Russian squadrons were rotated for training and gained exposure to actual combat. Before that, many pilots had not experienced any combat outside of Chechnya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Air Force underwent a series of reforms due to these failures. It was reorganized and renamed the Russian Aerospace Forces (the VKS) in 2015 as a result of many of these reforms, or what were claimed to be reforms. When the full-scale invasion happened in 2022, Russia’s VKS, like much of its military, was still trying to evolve from its targeted reforms and these earlier developmental challenges. They attempted a limited shock-and-awe offensive but failed miserably in areas such as battle damage assessment and other key aspects of a true air campaign (the second article in this series will touch on these issues in more detail).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, military reforms and adaptations in the Russian Air Force were not meant to stand alone. Russian kinetic actions were intended to be supported by other elements in non-contact warfare, aimed at softening the battlefield and undermining an adversary’s ability to fight. Prominent among these were active measures focused on information operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active Measures, Measures of Support, and Non-state Actors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning to Russian arms doctrine, Slipchenko and other figures on the General Staff argued that, in the post–Cold War world, especially after observing the 1991 Gulf War and the dominance of US airpower, massing military forces was no longer effective. The world saw how Saddam’s large army, with thousands of tanks and armored vehicles, was destroyed from the air. Slipchenko claimed that future wars will focus on disrupting enemy systems, including military, economic, social, and other so-called “information means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was not a new concept for Russia and its intelligence agencies—the FSB, GRU, and SVR (collectively the Russian intelligence services or RIS). The RIS would play a key role by using a well-known Russian technique—active measures, or as the RIS calls them today, measures of support. These tactics aim to weaken the enemy's ability to fight through malign influence, political interference, and disinformation. The Russians use state agencies and means, like their intelligence services, but also so-called non-state actors, like organized crime, private mercenaries, hacker groups, and many others, to carry out these and other hybrid actions as proxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctrinal approach of gray war, or new generation warfare, was gaining attention in Russia just as Putin's reign started. His rule coincided with the growing influence of the RIS within the government. It was natural for the RIS to take on roles the military was not equipped to perform, and Putin was quick to authorize them. One of the first tests for their active measures and gray war was Russia’s brief war with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fpri.org/article/2025/03/russian-influence-operations-in-georgia-a-threat-to-democracy-and-regional-stability/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Georgia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2008. As noted above, and while their military’s performance was mixed, their intelligence services were very active in the information arena. Russia flooded international media with its version of events. Their still-growing “RTV” news network promoted stories of atrocities they claimed were committed by the Georgian military. Europe and the U.S. were caught off guard and unprepared by the conflict; there was little to no meaningful response to Russia’s military actions, and no high costs or reprisals. It was a lesson Russia would remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Georgia in 2008, while reforms were introduced in the air force in particular, the doctrinal debates continued. Building on Slipchenko’s ideas, writers from the General Staff, such as General Chekinov and General Bogdanov, further developed the doctrine they called “new-generation warfare.” Their work emphasized scripted roles in conflict for the information-psychological struggle, subversion, and cyber operations, while traditional large-scale combat operations became, by comparison, less prominent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the current Russian Chief of Staff,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/world/europe/russia-hybrid-war-gerasimov.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Valeriy Gerasimov, gave a speech in which he also advocated for a constant “second front” of information operations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against Russia’s enemies to weaken their ability to wage war. This speech and a later article became known in some circles in the West as the “Gerasimov doctrine,” although it was never officially called that in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerasimov’s speech and article focused on shifting Russia's attention to countering the so-called “color revolutions” that occurred in the first decade of this century in Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan. They were, and still are, viewed as a direct threat to Russia’s national security and to Putin’s dictatorship. Russia cannot tolerate functioning democracies and freedom on its borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining Gerasimov’s contributions with those of Slipchenko, Gareev, and others, the Russian military developed a concept of non-contact warfare that planned for long-range strikes executed after weakening the enemy through non-kinetic means. They de-emphasized large ground formations because, according to the theory, they should not be necessary. Russian measures of support are designed to weaken an adversary through disinformation, misinformation, malign influence on politics, and other methods. This would become the battle plan the Russians would attempt to implement in Ukraine in 2014 (and again, with adjustments, in 2022).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As cyber has taken a greater role in society and the mass media, the Russian grey zone approach has also increasingly included RIS cyber operations and online media manipulation to support “reflexive control,” an old Russian intelligence concept from the 1960s. The term reflects the notion of influencing an adversary to act in a desired way without the enemy’s awareness. Gerasimov and the military, along with leaders of the RIS, knew from Russia’s poor performance in Georgia that they were not ready for war with NATO or any strong peer-level adversary. They needed help to weaken any adversary with a capable armed force before actual war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syria and Ukraine would be the new testing grounds for this concept in practice, with a heavy reliance on the intelligence services to help prepare the battlefield before and through the military’s engagement. Their perceived successes in both theaters would, over time, convince the Russian intelligence services, its military, and most importantly, President Putin that Russia was ready for a much larger task— an attack on and seizure of the entire territory of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the US Government.

Yet now, a man who has never been willing to retreat confronts a dilemma from which there is no clean exit: continued internal war against his own people, or an external war that exposes his regime's fragility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent experiment involving 150 French citizens shows that when the conditions for achieving fiscal sustainability are clear and the trade-offs transparent, voters are prepared to support difficult budgetary decisions. What has been missing from the current process is not consent, but an effective method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After decades of the one-child policy, the decline in China's fertility rate was inevitable, like a boulder rolling down a hill. With the problem now being compounded by numerous other factors, pushing the boulder back uphill will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, and will not happen quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the year began, US President Donald Trump has ramped up his aggression in the Western Hemisphere, including military intervention in Venezuela and threats to impose large sanctions on European Union countries that oppose US annexation of Greenland. Suddenly, the international order – institutions, understandings, and alliances – that underpinned economic growth for generations are at risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Long Arc Of American Power</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-long-arc-of-american-power</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;“We [the U.S.] began as a sliver of a country and next thing you know we're a continental power, and we did not do that primarily through our great diplomacy and our good looks and our charm. We did that primarily by taking the land from other people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was Michael O’Hanlon, the Brookings Institution’s Director of Research in the Foreign Policy program, speaking January 12, about his new book&lt;em&gt;, To Dare Mighty Things: U.S. Defense Strategy Since the Revolution&lt;/em&gt;, on a panel with retired-Gen. David Petraeus and Historian Robert Kagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Hanlon continued, “Now, this is not a revisionist history that's meant to beat up on the United States for having become a world power, because if we hadn't done that, if we hadn't become this continental power, then we could never have prevailed in the World Wars…The world would have been a much worse place and we could never have played the role we did in the Cold War and at least up until recent times, the post-Cold-War world. So generally speaking, I'm glad for this American assertiveness, but to me, it's striking just how little we understand that about ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening to that event eight days ago at Brookings, and looking around at what the Trump administration is doing at home and abroad today, I thought elements of what I heard from these three were worth repeating and reviewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, O’Hanlon pointed out a great amount of U.S. grand strategy and national security thinking took place during historic periods considered times of American isolationism and retrenchment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Hanlon said, “A lot of the institutional machinery, a lot of the intellectual and leadership development capability of the United States began in this period starting in the late 19th century and accelerating into the inner [World] War years [1918-to-1941]. And without that, we would not have had the great leaders like [Gen. Dwight D.] Eisenhower, and [Gen. George C.] Marshall, trained in the way they were. I think that made them ready for World War II.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, “We would not have had many of the innovations that occurred in this period of time -- so whether it's [Rear Admiral William A.] Moffett and [Navy] air power and [aircraft] carrier power, [Army Brig. Gen.] Billy Mitchell and the development of the Army Air Corps, [Marine Maj. Gen. John A.] Lejeune and the thinking about amphibious warfare. A lot of these great military leaders and innovators were doing their thing in the early decades of the 20th century and including in the inner war years in ways that prepared us for all these new innovations, all these new kinds of operations that would prove so crucial in World War II.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To me it's sort of striking,” O’Hanlon said, “how quickly we got momentum in World War II, given how underprepared we were in terms of standing armies and navies and capabilities. And by early 1943 at the latest, I think we're basically starting to win that war, which is faster than we've often turned things around in many of our conflicts in our history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagan, a Brookings senior fellow and author of the 2012 book &lt;em&gt;The World America&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Made&lt;/em&gt;, picked up on American assertiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ideologically, the United States was expansive,” Kagan said, “We had a universalist ideology. We got upset when we saw liberalism being attacked, even back in the 1820s. You know, a lot of Americans wanted to help the Greek rebellion [against the Ottoman Empire]. The world was very ideological in the 19th century and we saw ourselves as being on the side of liberalism and freedom versus genuine autocracies like Russia and Austria and Prussia. And so we always had these sympathies. Now everybody would say wait a second it's none of our business blah blah blah blah, but nevertheless the general trend was we cared.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagan went on, “People keep doing things out there that we're finding offensive in one way or another. And so we're like wanting to do something about it. So then we get dragged into, [or] we drag ourselves into these conflicts and then we say, ‘Wait a second, we're perfectly safe here [protected east and west by the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans]. Why are we involved in all this stuff?’ And then we want to come back. And so this tension between our essential security on the one hand and…our kind of busy bodyness in the world has just been has been a constant -- and I think explains why we have vacillated in terms of our military capability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petraeus, began by saying, “I'm a soldier not a historian here,” and then defended some past U.S. interventions as “basically when we've been attacked,” citing Pearl Harbor and ships being sunk in the Atlantic. He added, “Sometimes it's and/or when we fear hostile powers especially, if they're aligned as it was during the Cold War with the communists, or now arguably with China and/or Russia or both taking control of again Eurasia, Southeast Asia, East Asia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petraeus admitted, “We have sometimes misread that. You can certainly argue that Vietnam was arguably more nationalist [North Vietnamese seeking independence from France] maybe than it was communist. But that I think still applies. I think one of the motivations with respect to [Venezuelan President Nicolas] Maduro is that they [the Maduro Venezuelan leadership] were more closely than ever aligning with China, Iran to a degree, Russia and so forth. And we've seen that play out on a number of occasions as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

If they're going to be on the ground, then employ advise, assist, and enable operations where it's the host nation forces or partner forces that are on the front lines rather than Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, Petraeus said, “I think we were unprepared definitely intellectually for these operations after toppling regimes in Iraq and Afghanistan and not just [in] the catastrophically&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;bad post-conflict as phase,” citing “horrific decisions to fire the entire Iraqi military without telling them what their future was. And then firing the Baath Party down to the level of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;bureaucrats. That meant that tens of thousands [of Iraqis] without an agreed reconciliation process are literally cast out. And by the way, they're the bureaucrats that we needed to actually help us run a country [Iraq] we didn't sufficiently understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describing another lesson learned, Petraeus said, “In looking back on Afghanistan, trying to distill what happened, what we did wrong, what we did right, I really concluded that we were never truly committed to Afghanistan nation building. Rather, we were repeatedly committed to exiting. And that was a huge challenge [for the 20 years the U.S. was there], because if you tell the enemy that you're going to draw down on a given date, during the speech in which you announce a buildup, really undermines the enemy's sense of your will in what is a contest of wills at the end of the day. Not saying that we didn't want to draw down, but to do it according to the right conditions. And of course then the other challenge was that the draw-down became much more based on conditions in Washington than it did on conditions in Afghanistan, which is again another pretty fatal flaw.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagan gave his view on past American interventions with U.S. troops in foreign countries, and tied them sharply to today’s situation, not only in Caracas, but also in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You know, the United States did not go to war in Iraq to promote democracy despite the vast mythology that has grown up about that,” Kagan began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then continued, “It was primarily fear of security. Saddam was a serial aggressor. He certainly was working on weapons of mass destruction. Rightly or wrongly that was the primary motive [of the George W. Bush administration]. But then Americans, as always the case, and you know, all you have to do is look at what we did in Germany after World War II, what we did in Japan after World War II. Americans never felt very comfortable about moving into some country, taking it over for whatever reason and then turning it over to some dictator. We wanted to be able to say that we left something like democratic governance behind. Until now that has been such a key element of our self-perception and our character.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

And so we're now [with Venezuela] we’re back in that mode.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But here, Kagan gave his view of an important change from the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said, “So here's what's different. We did not want to leave in Iraq Saddam's number two. Go ahead, take over. In Venezuela, we've gone after a regime head…[but] this isn't regime change. This is decapitation and now we've turned it over to the next, you know, part of the Maduro regime and said you take care of it. We'll run it, but you take care of it. That is a departure from American history and I think it is directly a consequence of the fact that for the first time I can&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;say without any doubt we do not have a president who believes in the American principles of liberalism, but is actively hostile to them here in the United States as well as internationally. He is on the side of anti-liberalism. He is on the side of authoritarianism, both here and abroad. That, to my mind, it's not do we intervene in Latin America, Yes, we do, but for what purpose? And I think that is the huge break [from the past] that we're witnessing right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To my mind and others, Kagan has it right. President Trump, facing political problems at home – affordability, the Epstein files, the upcoming November House and Senate elections – has tried to show expanding power abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on past success in Iran bombing nuclear sites and removing Maduro from Venezuela, Trump wants to absorb Greenland, send U.S. forces into Mexico after drug cartels, and threaten attacking the faltering regime in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me add a final element to Trump’s current eagerness to show power abroad. The one thing he doesn’t want is the death of any U.S. military personnel he sends into harm’s way. Trump and his top aides have repeatedly pointed out, whether it was in blowing up narco-trafficking boats or the Iran bombing or the Maduro snatch, no American lives were lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>New Reports Reveal Years of Unaddressed Osprey Safety Risks</title>

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/san-diego-california-october-21-a-u-s-marine-corps-bell-boeing-v-22-osprey-tilt-rotor-aircraft-flies-at-sunset-while-traini.jpg?id=62833386&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C53%2C0%2C54&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP DIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;It is one of the most lauded defense developments in recent decades, providing preeminent capability to U.S. military personnel worldwide, but that prowess evidently comes with a steep cost that military leadership allowed to grow for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics have long asserted that the military failed to adequately address a mounting series of safety issues with the V-22 Osprey aircraft, even as service members died in preventable crashes. The Naval Air Systems Command&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.usni.org/2025/12/12/navy-and-gao-reports-v-22-osprey-program&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Government Accountability Office&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/12/new-gao-navy-reports-warn-serious-v-22-osprey-safety-risks-some-fixes-stretching-2030s/410150/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; paint a scathing portrait of systemic failures by the Joint Program Office overseeing V-22 variants for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Marine Corps&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.usni.org/2025/09/16/report-to-congress-on-v-22-osprey-aircraft&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;operates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; approximately 348 MV-22s, the Air Force 52 CV-22s, and the Navy 29 CMV-22s, with the program of record at around 464 total across services. Japan operates 17 MV-22s, with deliveries complete or near-complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Deadly Track Record&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 30 U.S. Marines lost their lives in three&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/12/new-gao-navy-reports-warn-serious-v-22-osprey-safety-risks-some-fixes-stretching-2030s/410150/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;separate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; crashes during the testing and development phase throughout the 1990s, giving the Osprey the nickname “The Widow Maker.” Since its introduction in 2007, at least 35&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48703&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;servicemembers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have died in 10 fatal crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Initially, the V-22 suffered from Vortex Ring State, which produced crashes during development. The problem was diagnosed and remediated, and the loss rate went down dramatically,” John Pike, a leading defense, space and intelligence policy expert and Director of GlobalSecurity.org, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Subsequent losses have been ‘normal accidents’ due to the usual mechanical and human failings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GAO&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/2025/12/gao-finds-v-22-serious-accident-rate-shot-up-in-2023-2024/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;found&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that serious Osprey mishaps in 2023 and 2024 exceeded the previous eight years and generally surpassed accident rates of other Navy and Air Force aircraft. In August 2023, three Marines died in Australia. In 2022, four U.S. soldiers were killed in a NATO training mission, and five Marines were killed in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unresolved Problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NAVAIR report&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2025-12-12/navy-investigation-finds-osprey-safety-issues-were-allowed-to-grow-for-years&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;revealed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “the cumulative risk posture of the V-22 platform has been growing since initial fielding,” and the program office “has not promptly implemented fixes.” Of 12 Class A mishaps in the past four years, seven involved parts failures already identified as major problems but not addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues with hard-clutch engagement (HCE) caused the July 2022 California crash that killed five. The problem occurs when the clutch connecting the engine to the propeller gearbox slips and reengages abruptly, causing a power spike that can throw the aircraft into an uncontrolled roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were eight Air Force servicemembers killed in the November 2023 crash off Yakushima Island when a catastrophic propeller gearbox failed due to cracks in the metal pinion gear, and the pilot continued flying despite multiple warnings, contributing to the crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This manufacturing issue&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2025-12-12/navy-investigation-finds-osprey-safety-issues-were-allowed-to-grow-for-years&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;dates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to 2006, but the Joint Program Office didn’t formally assess the risk until March 2024 – nearly two decades later.

As five of the eight Navy helicopters that arrived at Desert One were inoperable, it was clear that rapid troop movement in harsh environmental conditions was urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After development began in 1985, the Osprey entered service in 2007, replacing the Vietnam-era CH-46 Sea Knight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to fixed-wing transports, the Osprey can land troops just where they are needed. Airdrops with parachutes tend to scatter paratroops all over the place; see ‘Saving Private Ryan,’” Pike explained. “And compared with other rotary wing aircraft, the Osprey is much faster and has a much longer range.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Osprey shifts from helicopter to airplane mode in under 12 seconds, reaches speeds of 315 mph, has an operational range of 580 miles, and carries 10,000 pounds – or 24 troops. It’s used for missions ranging from combat operations to the occasional transport of White House staff. During a dust storm in Afghanistan in 2010, two CV-22 helicopters rescued 32 soldiers in under four hours from a distance of 800 miles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic Readiness Problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet these performance advantages have been undercut by persistent readiness shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NAVAIR report&lt;a href=&quot;https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/v-22-ospreys-safety-risks-navair-review-confirms/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;noted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that mission-capable rates between 2020 and 2024 averaged just 50 percent for the Navy and Air Force, and 60 percent for Marines. The Osprey&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2025/12/12/v-22-osprey-at-risk-of-more-catastrophic-mishaps-navy-review-finds/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;requires&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 100 percent more unscheduled maintenance than the Navy averages and 22 maintenance man-hours per flight hour versus 12 for other aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Boeing settled a whistleblower lawsuit in 2023 for $8.1 million after employees accused the company of falsifying records for composite part testing. Boeing, in its defense,&lt;a href=&quot;https://halifax.citynews.ca/2023/12/07/ospreys-had-safety-issues-long-before-they-were-grounded-a-look-at-the-aircrafts-history/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;claimed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the parts were “non-critical” and did not impact flight safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflicting Views on Safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Osprey does not have a troubled safety record. Per a recent press release, the V-22 mishap rate per 100,000 flight hours is 3.28, which is in line with helicopters with similar missions.” a government source who works closely with the Osprey fleet but is not authorized to speak on the record contended to &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Like anything measured statistically, there are periods above and below the mean. Just because humans tend to conclude because of apparent clusters doesn’t necessarily mean there is a pattern or connection – think of how some people say that ‘celebrities die in threes.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source vowed that “the design issues, such as certain electrical wiring rubbing against hydraulic and oil lines, were fixed before fleet introduction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problems with the test plan were a product of pressure applied to accelerate a delayed and overbudget program and were not repeated when the aircraft was reintroduced,” the insider pointed out. “Those mishaps, combined with the distinctive nature of the V-22, mean that any subsequent incident, major or minor, is always viewed as part of the ‘dangerous V-22’ narrative. A U.S. Army Blackhawk crash in November killed five but barely made the news. A Japanese Blackhawk crash killed ten soldiers in April, but the Japanese didn’t ground their Blackhawks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That perception, however, has done little to quiet families who argue that known risks went unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amber Sax’s husband, Marine Corps Capt. John J. Sax died in the 2022 California crash caused by hard clutch engagement, a problem the Marine Corps had known about for over a decade. “Their findings confirm what we already know: More needs to be done, and more needs to be done,” Sax&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/12/new-gao-navy-reports-warn-serious-v-22-osprey-safety-risks-some-fixes-stretching-2030s/410150/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s clear in the report that these risks were not properly assessed, and that failure cost my husband his life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

In 2018, the Marine Corps Aviation proposal&lt;a href=&quot;https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/marine-corps-fly-osprey-2060-prep-aircraft-future-wars-31517&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;outlined&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a sustainability plan for the Osprey to at least 2060.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The quality of maintenance training curricula, maturation, and standardization has not kept pace with readiness requirements,” the report&lt;a href=&quot;https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/marine-corps-fly-osprey-2060-prep-aircraft-future-wars-31517&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;stated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Current maintenance manning levels are unable to support demands for labor. The current V-22 sustainment system cannot realize improved and sustained aircraft readiness and availability without significant change. Depot-level maintenance cannot keep up with demand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite extensive recommendations – NAVAIR&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/2025/12/gao-finds-v-22-serious-accident-rate-shot-up-in-2023-2024/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;underscored&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 32 actions to improve safety – Vice Adm. John Dougherty reaffirmed commitment to the aircraft. Pike believes it’s a matter of when, not if, the Osprey returns to full operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once the issues are fixed, everyone will resume their regular programming,” he asserted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials and insiders alike expect that process to translate into tangible fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would expect that to lead to some type of corrective action, whether it’s a new procedure or replacing a defective part,” the insider added. “After that, I would expect a long career for the aircraft in the Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force, as it’s an irreplaceable part of all three services now and gives a unique capability to the American military.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether that optimism proves warranted depends on whether military leadership finally addresses the systemic failures the latest reports have laid bare – failures that cost 20 service members their lives in just the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The World Economic Forum meeting in Davos will feature the usual pledges about stakeholder capitalism, purpose-driven business, and sustainable development. But without binding conditionalities, accountability frameworks, and risk-sharing that distinguish genuine value creators from rent extractors, it remains theater.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Global financial stability has long depended on the dollar’s role as the main reserve currency, with the expectation that the United States would both set the rules and uphold them. As American leadership grows more erratic, that dependence has become a vulnerability, underscoring the need for a multicurrency system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tech evangelists view climate change as an information problem that the arrival of AI superintelligence will solve, rather than a willpower problem that requires concrete measures, like modernizing the electrical grid and implementing a carbon tax. But there can be no miracle fix once critical planetary tipping points are crossed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To ensure that Greenland remains a territory of Denmark, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other European leaders must put pressure on NATO’s most powerful member. Given the US president’s love of royalty, one way to do that would be to organize a public meeting between British King Charles III and Danish King Frederik X.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Coast Guard's Mission in the Gray Zone</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-coast-guard-s-mission-in-the-gray-zone</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION&lt;/strong&gt; — U.S. defense planning rests on the assumption that wars are fought abroad, by expeditionary forces, against defined adversaries. For decades, those assumptions held. But today, many of the most consequential security challenges facing the United States violate all three. They occur closer to home, below the threshold of armed conflict, and in domains where sovereignty is enforced incrementally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift has exposed a chronic mismatch between how the United States defines its defense priorities and how it allocates resources and respect. While defense discourse continues to stubbornly emphasize power projection and high-end conflict, many of today’s challenges revolve around the more modest and rote enforcement of U.S. territorial integrity and national sovereignty - functions that are vital to U.S. strategic objectives yet lack the optical prestige of winning wars abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the center of this gap between prestige and need is the U.S. Coast Guard, whose mission profile aligns directly with America’s most important strategic objectives - the enforcement of sovereignty and homeland defense - yet remains strategically undervalued because its work rarely resembles the celebrated and well-funded styles of conventional warfighting. In an era of increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/gray-zone-warfare&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;gray-zone&lt;/a&gt; competition and persistent coercion, the failure to properly appreciate the Coast Guard threatens real strategic fallout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third decade of the 21st century, U.S. defense planning remains heavily oriented toward expeditionary warfighting and high-end kinetic conflict. Budget conversations still revolve around Ford-class supercarriers, F-35 fighters, and A2/AD penetration. This orientation shapes not only force design and budget allocations, but also institutional prestige and political capital. The services associated with visible combat power, with the Ford-class and the F-35, continue to dominate strategic discourse—even as many of the most persistent security challenges confronting the United States unfold close to home, in the gray-zone, without the need for fifth-generation air power or heavy armor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It’s never been more important to understand what’s happening in the world.

Power projection, forward presence, and deterrence abroad are important—but they are secondary functions derived from the primary purpose of homeland defense. Yet U.S. defense discourse often treats homeland defense as a background condition when it should be revered as the first priority. The result is a blind spot in how security resources are evaluated and allocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coast Guard operates at a unique point where law enforcement, military authority, and sovereign enforcement all converge. On any given day, the Coast Guard may board foreign-flagged vessels suspected of sanctions violations, police maritime borders against illicit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-u-s-coast-guards-quiet-drug-war-wins-amid-trumps-caribbean-strikes&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;trafficking&lt;/a&gt;, secure ports that underpin global supply chains, and maintain a persistent presence in contested spaces, like the Arctic, without inviting escalation. The Coast Guard is equipped to intercept illegal fishing fleets, escort commercial shipping through sensitive waterways, and assert jurisdiction in legally ambiguous areas. These activities rarely resemble traditional warfighting, they rarely result in a Hollywood blockbuster, and they can be accomplished without nuclear-powered submarines or intercontinental ballistic missiles. But these are not peripheral activities—they are arguably amongst the most important daily functions the U.S. military undertakes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinct among the military branches, the Coast Guard operates under a legal framework that is uniquely suited to today’s security environment. Under Title 14 status, the Coast Guard falls within the Department of Homeland Security, conducting law enforcement and regulatory missions on a daily basis. Yet, when needed, the service can transition to Title 10 status, under the Department of Defense, and operate as an armed service when required. This agility allows the Coast Guard to remain continuously engaged across the spectrum of competition, whether enforcing U.S. law in peacetime, managing escalation in gray-zone encounters, or integrating seamlessly into military operations. Few other elements of U.S. power can move so fluidly between legal regimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, despite such strategic relevance, the Coast Guard suffers from a persistent optical problem. U.S. defense culture has long privileged services and missions associated with visible, kinetic combat—those that lend themselves to clear narratives of victory, sacrifice, and heroism. The Coast Guard’s work rarely fits that cinematic mold. Its success is measured not in territory seized or targets destroyed, but in disruptions prevented, borders enforced, and crises that never materialize. Inherently quiet work with outcomes that reflect a force operating exactly as designed, although without generating institutional prestige or political support. In a system that rewards the loudest and the brightest, the Coast Guard’s quiet enforcement of sovereignty is easy to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

Specifically, persistent underinvestment in the Coast Guard weakens maritime domain awareness, reduces sustained presence in key waterways, and narrows the set of tools available to manage gray-zone competition. As adversaries increasingly rely on legal ambiguity, deniable actors, and incremental pressure to test U.S. resolve, gaps in enforcement become opportunities. In this environment, the absence of credible, continuous sovereignty enforcement invites probing behavior that becomes harder to deter over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocacy for the Coast Guard does not require reassigning prestige, or elevating one service at the expense of others. It is merely an argument for strategic alignment. If territorial integrity, sovereignty enforcement, and homeland defense are truly core national-security priorities, then the institutions most directly responsible for those missions should be treated accordingly. As competition increasingly unfolds in the gray-zone between peace and war, the United States will need forces designed not only to win conflicts—but to prevent them from starting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>The Country’s First ‘Cognitive Advantage’ Chief: Influence Is the New Battlefield</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-countrys-first-cognitive-advantage-chief-influence-is-the-new-battlefield</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/washington-dc-united-states-december-1-an-exterior-view-of-the-white-house-in-washington-dc-united-states-on-december-1-2.jpg?id=62826168&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C68%2C0%2C69&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEEKEND INTERVIEW — &lt;/strong&gt;In an era when foreign adversaries can shape public sentiment with a well-timed meme and a handful of AI-driven accounts, the U.S. government is racing to redefine what national power looks like in the information age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the center of that effort is Shawn Chenoweth, the country’s first Director of Cognitive Advantage - a role designed to help the United States compete in the domain where modern influence, persuasion, and political outcomes are increasingly decided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, exactly, does a Director of Cognitive Advantage do? It’s not a title most Americans encounter, and it sits far outside the familiar contours of diplomacy, military force, or economic leverage. But as Chenoweth explains, the contest for influence no longer stays neatly within those lanes either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His focus is often on the gray space - where information, perception, culture, and behavior collide, and where adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are operating with staggering resources and strategic focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;em&gt;Cipher Brief &lt;/em&gt;conversation, Chenoweth breaks down how cognitive operations actually work, why the U.S. has struggled to keep pace, and what it means to give the President an “information option” that’s not simply kinetic or economic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He offers rare, candid insight into how technology, AI, and social platforms—from TikTok to algorithmically driven personas—are reshaping the battlespace faster than policymakers can write doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our conversation is a deep dive into one of the least understood - but perhaps most consequential - fronts of modern national security. &lt;em&gt;Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Chenoweth&lt;/strong&gt;, Director of Cognitive Advantage, National Security Council&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE INTERVIEW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: How do you explain the role of the director of Cognitive Advantage?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;When you look at traditional elements of military power, you probably think of the DIME construct&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It's not a perfect construct, but it's pretty good. DIME, is broken down into Diplomatic, Information, Military and Economic, and it's very clear who owns the Diplomatic, Military, and Economic components. But there hasn't been, at least in several decades, a good example of where people have really come to the president and the administration with an &quot;I&quot; option, for Information. And it's a shame because when you actually look at the DIME construct, you don't want to break it into stove pipes. We should think of it as a cell. Each of those elements acts as part of a functioning cell, and removing any of those elements means you have an imperfect or failing cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I was asked to help put the &quot;I&quot; back in DIME so that we can provide additional options and advantages across the other elements of DIME to national power and provide the president with opportunities to accomplish the Administration’s objectives that aren't just warheads on foreheads or threatening economics or expending political leverage. We can enhance those things, but we can also gain advantages by using cognitive effects through the information environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Let’s set the stage a bit further. If you were to explain to the average American what is happening in terms of cognitive warfare in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/how-can-the-u-s-better-manage-the-gray-zone&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;gray zone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; – the area where conflict occurs below the level of warfare - how would you describe it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I think if you look through your military histories, philosophers, politicians, political science, it's all pretty clear. You can pick out the elements. They all have one underlying thread, which is that political victory is the one that matters at its core. That's really what we're talking about. Nothing's changed. How human beings are connected, how technology is affected has certainly changed. But what we really care about is what people do in the real world and the geophysical world, the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the point of a cognitive advantage is to leverage that so that human beings are taking behaviors favorable to outcomes, to national objectives, which most of the time are also - in the case of the United States - favorable in their own right. So it's core. And that is what we're driving to get: those advantages in what people do in the real world through their sensing, to make decisions that come back to the real world and have the effects that you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Can you give an example of what that would look like?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Let's say you're negotiating for a piece of land or a base that you need for overflight intel collection. You're going to conduct a trade-off in negotiations. Maybe it's going to look like, - if you pay more, you'll get more - based off what the value proposition is. But very rarely is it that blatant and simple. So, what you want to be able to do is understand, what advantage would we need in the negotiation? What's actually driving this other party other than maybe just cost or just danger? What’s the risk calculus?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are cultural nuances that affect things: their understanding of influence, political implications. So, the point would be to understand why they would be interested in this in the first place? What advantage does it give them? What are the cultural nuances? Why wouldn't they do this in the first place? Why aren't they taking this action and what can we do to make sure that the outcome is what we want?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other areas where that applies across the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's say we're conducting counter-terrorism operations, and we know an objective tends to use a particular cafe. Well, what if they were using a different one that day? What can we do to influence them to go to a place that's more favorable for options to decrease our own risk calculus, either because we want to conduct a kinetic strike or make an arrest? Maybe we can't find them. So, what if we use that for our intel collection and our methods to basically make them come up on comms and change their behavior so it's easier to find them, collect on them, and build the data so that we can conduct physical actions to stop or disrupt them? And you can kind of see how that applies across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you know more than the person you're dealing with, chances are that you're going to be better at accomplishing your outcome. It’s very similar with the werewolf theory. It's a game where two people are chosen to be the werewolf of the village and everyone else in the group doesn't know who the werewolf is. Most of the time the people who are the werewolves win the game because they have an information advantage over everyone else playing the game. So, it's a human norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And again, I point out that nothing's new under the sun. It's just that we haven't really thought through the implications of what it means in the information age that we live in - where everyone is connected through software defined radios. We're a long way away from direct sensing where it's communication and things happening in the real world. Now we have sort of indirect sensing where you're fed data feeds and everything else. We can affect cognitive behavior in ways we never imagined, and we really haven't thought through just as we can reach people and sell items. And if I want to find a person whose favorite color is red, who's a military age male who's really into Magnum PI, I can find that person thanks to their radio, and I can craft messages specifically for someone who fits that demographic and move them in a particular direction. That's the first time in history that that's been the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: You have a background that combines both government and private sector experience. Given that technology is being rapidly developed in the private sector, how do you think that background gives you an advantage in this role?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; There are a lot of people who've served in the military and have been contractors but just by happenstance, I happen to have been in a lot of critical locations at critical times. I think one of the advantages that has brought me is that I saw the frustration within the military when the contracting apparatus didn't work. I was also empowered by industry to go and fix a lot of those structures and enable the government to do it, and now I'm getting afforded the opportunity to work on policy to make the system really hum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the advantage with that is that when it comes to the information space, there's no control. And I try to emphasize this to any policy maker or power broker or decision maker that I can find. You can put an armored brigade in an intersection - fully equipped, fully supported – and a U.S. Armored Brigade could own that intersection. There are things you can control. But when it comes to the information space, there is no control. It is constantly shifting, constantly changing. You have a binary decision. You are either going to participate, preferably at a level that matters, or not, and whatever's going to happen is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you could find yourself in an advantageous information space in the morning, lose it by the late morning, get a stalemate in the afternoon, and win it back in the afternoon – just to lose it again at the end of the day. And when you wake up the next morning, you're going to have to do it all over again. There is no, &quot;We have information dominance and we're done and we can crack our beers and go on with other things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not how this works because every day new information is being injected into the system. People are changing and developing new opinions. Things are occurring and people are going to react to those things, change their opinions, adapt, age out, age in, so those cultural references may change. It's a constant flux. One of the things that from the U.S. government side we're getting our head around is that we need an information carrier group constantly operating afloat in the information environment, effectively. One that’s engaged 24/7 to affect these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is partnering with the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Information Professionals Association and the National Center for Narrative Intelligence to bring you Pinnacle 2026: Gray Zone Convergence: Cognitive Security at the Intersection of Influence, Innovation, and Shared Interests. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://information-professionals.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2044c7e92c443c50b2129bd22&amp;amp;id=61b2b7f847&amp;amp;e=f8392d200d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://information-professionals.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2044c7e92c443c50b2129bd22&amp;amp;id=61b2b7f847&amp;amp;e=f8392d200d&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Register for the February 9-10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; conference now to secure your spot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: It's not just the United States that has gotten pretty good at understanding the impact of cognitive advantage. We see these tactics from China and Russia being used with stunning success. In this role, how focused are you on their activities when it comes to doing the exact same thing that you're tasked with doing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;They absolutely practice these activities. I call them the ‘CRINKETT’. Every challenge we're generally dealing with falls in the CRINKETTS. It's China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Terrorists and Trans[national] criminals. And particularly for the nation states, this is exactly how they want to compete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From their perspective, there are two ways to deal with the United States: asymmetrically and stupidly, largely because of our economic and military power. They get that. They're not interested in a kinetic fight; that is an awful prospect. So the way they want to do this is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/gray-zone-warfare&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;gray zone activities&lt;/a&gt;, in the information space, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/21st-century-cognitive-advantage&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;cognitive domain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they outspend us. I'm not going to say necessarily outperform, but I'll say if you want to compete at a level that matters, they outspend us, period. Iran probably spends around $1.8 billion plus-minus a year, maybe more with their proxies and everything else they do in this particular space. Russia - post Ukraine invasion, spends about $2.6 billion, something like that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/china-gray-zone-war&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; - 48 plus billion dollars a year. The U.S., if I take all of the activities from the DoD, the State Department and everything else, and you put those together, you might approach $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't mean we're executing those funds either. It just means that that's what we've allocated. When you think about how we outspend to have an advantage on the other parts of DIME, we're hideously underperforming here. And again, all props to the administration. They're acutely aware of this and the support I've had at the National Security Council and across the elements of government - the departments and agencies - has been stellar. And we're going to continue to work on this and get it right because we have three and a half more years of President Trump's administration to get this right, do the reps and sets, and make this a durable policy so that the American people can start enjoying those benefits that come when we're really focused on this space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: What does success look like for you in this role and how do you measure it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Measurement has always been a funny thing. People will constantly tell me how hard it is to measure these activities. And what I’ve found time and time again is that we're actually pretty good at these activities. The issues with the measurements are, again, participating at a scale that matters. We need to measure behavior change, and in order to do that, we need to have clear objectives. What are we after?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big part of that is who is the target audience that has the agency to do the thing we want? We spend a lot of time making plans and CONOPS [Concept of Operations] on sub-target audiences that don't actually have the agency – in hopes that they affect agency - and that's perfectly fine. But why are we doing assessments against this? We spend a lot of time and money generating assessments to target audiences that don't have the agency you want. So, let's focus on the target audience that has the agency and let's do this at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example; I'm in the DC area and I can go down to the Potomac River, drop a bucket of water in the river, and I have objectively molecularly increased the amount of water in the Potomac. There isn't a sensor on this planet that is going to detect that molecular change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact is that you might be having an effect, but you don't have a sensor that is going to pick that up. So, you need to increase your scale or customize your sensing system to the effect you're having. That tends to be where the assessments fall apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard all the time for decades now that assessments are so hard. I don't find that to be true. What I find is that you've sacrificed assessments for effect, which is fine. It's risk calculus. If I had a low amount of resources and I decided to put as much into the effect I've wanted, that's fine. But at the end of the day, you're looking for the real behavior change in the targeted audience that matters. What are the sensors you have on that and what are you doing to collect that data: public opinion, research surveys, building the networks. We're going to see this exacerbate further as the AI revolution continues at pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: How is technology impacting what you're trying to do, your mission, and then how are you also working with the private sector because the private sector is controlling so much of the technology and the innovation that the government needs to work with. So how are you doing that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;One of the challenges I see emerging from AI is that there's sort of an assumption that AI will fix all your woes. I've seen the best tools out there do one thing: they model the data they have, and that's the core issue. We don't have the data. So again, I'm back to there's not a whole lot of new things under the sun. And the AI models are really good, and it can allow you to find new insights from the data that you have, but new data needs to be created. So, sacrificing collection methodologies and new approaches to gather the data at the foot of a model is terrible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI snake oil salesman I would deal with in industry all the time would come in and say, ‘&lt;em&gt;Oh, you're interested in that? I could absolutely model you the thing&lt;/em&gt;.’ Cool. How does that work? &lt;em&gt;‘Well, all you have to do is provide me the data and we'll put all this together and give you the insights.&lt;/em&gt;’ I'm like, &lt;em&gt;whoa&lt;/em&gt;. We don't have the data either. No one has the data. That's kind of the problem. So, let's be honest about what we're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is going to be a great boon for industry and for the government and everyone else under the sun. It's going to obviously have impact, but I think as that moves forward, we need to start looking at how we actually employ it. Building an agent or a token for every worker so that they're augmented by an AI that does the thing that they themselves may not be good at or saving them time is going to be amazing, but it needs to be undergirded by being able to detect what's actually happening out in the real world. And those two things are not necessarily - not interrelated. As I said, most things are kind of a whole cell that operate in one unit, and we can't necessarily bifurcate these things and then expect good outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Former Senior CIA Executive Dave Pitts wrote a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/how-can-the-u-s-better-manage-the-gray-zone&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;three-part series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; exclusively for The Cipher Brief on what the U.S. can do to become more competitive in the Gray Zone. Subscriber+Members can read it here.

If you could explaine to the average U.S. citizen how they might be targeted by cognitive operations that are conducted by U.S. adversaries, what would you tell them to look for?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;You need to be mindful of sources obviously. When I look at the construct of how we approach cognitive warfare, I think one of the biggest problems I've had for at least the last 10 years has been the construct of dis- and misinformation. My issue isn't the dis- and misinformation construct. It's the overuse of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disinformation and misinformation are things. They have meaning. But they mean something that is true and people use it for things that are not true. For example, disinformation are lies. The person projecting the information knows it's a lie. They're doing it to accomplish an objective. The bigger problem of disinformation is misinformation. Those are people who are sharing those lies, not knowing they are lies, or taking things out of context like satire, et cetera, and propagating as if it were truth. Those are what those are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not everything we have to deal with falls into that construct. There are two other portions to this that we have to be mindful of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is missing information, which used to mean that the target audience wasn't informed enough to make a correct decision, favorable to them or anyone else. ‘&lt;em&gt;It's a tragedy that your family member died and you should mourn their loss, but stop touching the body. That's how you're spreading Ebola&lt;/em&gt;’, right? Pretty straightforward, pretty simple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we're dealing with nation states with deep pockets, that's been flipped up on its head and they're practicing active missing information, where they will provide wire services into a country saying, &lt;em&gt;‘Congratulations, you can use our wire service for free and we'll provide you all the stuff, and that's your biggest cost except for labor. Isn't that wonderful? The catch is that you just have to use our wire service’&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think [contextual] stories are going to get into the press through those channels, good luck. This isn't happening in the third world. These are happening in major countries and places that would shock you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine something like,&lt;em&gt; ‘If you run this story, all our connected businesses that are connected through us or other means are going to pull their advertising budget from you.’&lt;/em&gt; So again, good luck talking about the story in your environment. No one's going to touch it. No influencer wants a piece of it because they're going to lose their incentive structure and their revenue stream. It's things like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the coin, and the bigger problem, is the rhetoric information. These are the things that aren't necessarily true or false. They are framed by your value system, how you view things, what you think truth actually is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are people out there who will say, I think a communist socialist form of government that is highly authoritarian is more stable and therefore better than a liberal democracy. There are people who believe that, and just by saying, well, history would prove you otherwise, it's not a good enough argument. You need to engage with those people at a scale that matters and be prepared to win the argument. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've seen this time again on the counter-terrorism front where we would shut down the comms of a nobody, and suddenly that person would come back with the reputation that was so valuable, and now they're a terrorist thought leader because the Western world thought that they were so dangerous they needed to be shut down instead of just accepting the fact, that maybe we should just engage with this guy because no one's ever heard of him and maybe we should just point out that he's a moron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are ways to deal with this, and just because we don't like something doesn't mean it's a lie to the person that's spreading it. They might believe it. Before we just title something disinformation and say, well, it's a lie and we can ignore it — that is not adequate in the modern era where everyone is connected because, again, this person has connective tissue to the internet. They have web platforms. They can be just as connected as a government if they should choose to be and if they have the popularity, because at its core, regardless of whether or not you're a government or a celebrity or anything else, you are fighting for attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: It’s sometimes difficult for busy Americans to navigate the information space today and know what to believe without inviting some serious time into the source. Do you look at part of your mission in this role as helping people understand more of the context they need in order to make good decisions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I've been more on the side dealing with foreign audiences. But even in that regard, I think that it really matters to ask what are the things that we know to be what we feel are objective truths and things that matter? Things that we want target audiences to know because we know it would be better for them and better for our objectives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then what are the things where we just want to make sure that if a debate needs to be had, we facilitate the debate so that the target audience, particularly with an American target audience - which again, it's not my forte, we don't do that in government or shouldn't — that needs to be facilitated by Americans pointing out to each other that we do need to have these debates and come to kind of consensus, understanding that there will be disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Do you think your job is going to be even more important in the future or maybe less?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I've never thought the job wasn't important. I think the thing I'm enjoying right now is that everyone's kind of getting their head around what this means. The overused expression that ‘&lt;em&gt;We need to do some things on Facebook&lt;/em&gt;,’ when you would have policymakers say, ‘&lt;em&gt;Well, I'm concerned that that would destroy Amazon and internet commerce’&lt;/em&gt; and your head would explode as you're trying to explain, ‘&lt;em&gt;That's just not how the internet works, man&lt;/em&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can be comfortable operating on these platforms and doing things that we need to do without destroying internet commerce or the internet. And now I think a lot of policy makers and industry are all connected. They're a lot more comfortable doing these things. Now is the time when we need to get to where the resources and the permissions really match the ability to get us where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've generally not found too many authority problems. I generally find permissions problems. I find that when it comes to authorities, you almost always find that every organization actually has a framework that allows them to do things. It's just that someone somewhere in the chain can say no and is all too comfortable saying no, because, particularly in the past administration, they were very comfortable at avoiding risk and not as comfortable at managing risk. And that is a dynamic that we have to change. The world is a risky place, and we need to be out there participating in it, throwing our elbows around and managing the risk, not avoiding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: How hard of a job is it to give the U.S. the cognitive advantage in today’s world?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It's hard, tremendously hard because you're talking about changing culture. I don't think the activity itself and the policy and the things that can be done are hard. I think the hard part will be changing the culture and changing people's mindsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've talked about the fact that there used to be three domains: physical domain, information domain and cognitive domain. We have to explore the information domain and actually call it what it is. There is the physical domain, the geophysical domain. But I like the ‘kill web’ approach. A good kill web will constitute a kill chain that is disrupted, and we have to get out of just a kill chain. We need to get into a kill web mentality when it comes to cognitive effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: Explain what you mean by a “kill web”?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You have your geophysical world where things exist in the real world, the place where we all live. When it comes to the information domain, though, it used to consolidate a bunch of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality is that when we break that down into a kill web, you're looking from your physical domain up to your logic layer. The internet is not some amorphous cloud that wanders around. It's composed of a system of systems that live in the real world. It's data centers, servers, modems, et cetera. Where does that infrastructure actually exist? Sometimes the files are in the computer. So, we need to be mindful of where does that work? How does the internet, how do these structures work, the mobile networks, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, it then creates the digital layer, where all the trons are that exist. You can have effects, that's where your real cyberspace comes into play. That's how the mobile devices work, but that is just data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it goes up to the persona entity level. These are the real human beings, sometimes fake human beings, they're personas, organizations but entities that potentially could be targeted or addressed or engaged, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there's the cognitive space. The trick in the cognitive space is what happens in the mind. And that mind is influenced by the sensing that goes up through that chain when they process it. You're able to interdict on its way up or influence, and you're able to influence on the way down when a decision is made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, when something happens in the real world, it's communicated to a decision maker, but it's going to go through the logic layer transmitted through sensors, computers, emails, phones, et cetera, to people and entities who are going to process it themselves, communicate it to a decision maker who's going to make a decision based off that information, or an individual or a bunch of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're all going to make decisions on how to react to that or not react to that. And that's going to go back down to the physical world when they say, ‘&lt;em&gt;I don't really like what is happening&lt;/em&gt;’, or maybe ‘&lt;em&gt;I do like what's happening. Let's do the thing’&lt;/em&gt;. They're going to communicate that down to ‘&lt;em&gt;Yes, launch the missiles’&lt;/em&gt;, or ‘&lt;em&gt;Let's have a protest’&lt;/em&gt;. So, you can affect the chain up. You can affect the chain down, but that's how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We as the United States have a pipe that exists inside that kill web structure - so does everyone else. And it doesn't matter if you're a nation state or a family or an individual. You have your sensing sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the direct conversations between people in the real world - even now, you and I are communicating completely over that entire structure - and that structure could be affected on the way up as we're communicating to when this is finally produced and goes back out to the real world where suddenly I have AI effects on me and I'm saying things I never meant to say, but the rest of the world's now interpreting that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't say that, that wasn't my cognitive decision, but you intercepted on the way down and now you would inadvertently affect everyone else's cognitive approach to what I'm communicating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly: What does the future from a technology and AI standpoint really look like?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chenoweth: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It's having fundamental changes. It's going to be interesting to see what happens in the entertainment industry as AI takes over and suddenly people can have more access. We've seen how the music industry went through huge change just on streaming music. We're about to witness what this is going to look like from our more traditional platforms. We've seen how things move from streaming. I think there is a level of adaptation that's going to go with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that needs to be addressed is how exactly we're going to engage. There is a point where we need to be comfortable with giving sort of guidance to the AIs - human in the loop - but if you think that you're going to be able to review every single message that needs to go out in an AI-driven world, you're out of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you need to be able to be comfortable generating for your target audience profiles and give sort of thematic guidance and let the AI do some level of engagements against foreign audiences to steer conversations in a particular direction, or at least identify where a conversation might be going so you can intervene when it looks like decisions are being made in a bad way, and then find out if that is an open and honest cultural nuance thing where it is about engagement or if it's being steered by your opponent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that we are not far, and we're probably already in a game, where there are AIs versus AIs as we speak in the information environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What U.S. – China Cooperation Means for the World</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/what-u-s-china-cooperation-means-for-the-world</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION --&lt;/strong&gt; China was very critical of the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last week. The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the U.S. action was “blatant interference” in Venezuela and a violation of international law. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Maduro was accused of working with Columbian guerrilla groups to traffic cocaine into the U.S. as part of a “narco-terrorism” conspiracy. Of all countries, China should appreciate the need to stop Mr. Maduro from smuggling these illicit drugs into the U.S., killing tens of thousands of Americans. China experienced this in the Opium War of 1839-1842, when Great Britain forced opium on China, despite government protestations, resulting in the humiliating Treaty of Nanjing, ceding Hong Kong to Great Britain. Mr. Maduro was violating U.S. laws, in a conspiracy to aid enemies and kill innocent Americans. Fortunately, the U.S. had the political will, and military might, to quickly and effectively put an end to this assault. China should understand this and withhold criticism, despite their close relationship with Mr. Maduro and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheduled April meeting of presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping will hopefully ease tension related to the South China Sea and Taiwan. The meeting will also offer an opportunity of the two presidents to elaborate on those transnational issues that the U.S. and China can work together on, for the common good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Security Strategy of 2025 states that deterring a conflict over Taiwan is a priority and does not support any unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.

Trump and Xi to candidly discuss the South China Sea and Taiwan and ensure that there are guardrails to prevent conflict. Quiet and effective diplomacy is needed to address these issues, and the Trump – Xi meeting could establish the working groups and processes necessary to ensure the U.S. and China do not stumble into conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also important are the transnational issues that require the attention of the U.S. and China. This shouldn’t be too difficult, given the history of cooperation between the U.S. and China, primarily in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it was China’s Chairman Deng Xiaoping who approved cooperation with the U.S. on the collection and sharing of intelligence on the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China opposed the December 1979 Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan and worked with the U.S. to provide weapons and supplies to the resistance forces in Afghanistan – who eventually prevailed, with the Soviet Union admitting defeat and pulling out of Afghanistan in 1989. The war in Afghanistan cost the Soviet Union immense resources, lives and prestige, weakening the Soviet Union and contributing to its later dissolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 1979 normalization of relations, the U.S. and China cooperated on a few transnational issues: nuclear nonproliferation; counternarcotics, focusing on Southeast Asia’s Golden Triangle and the heroin from Burma going into China and the U.S.; counterterrorism and the sharing of intelligence on extremist networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, Secretary of State Colin Powell asked China to assist with the denuclearization of North Korea. The following year, China hosted the Six-Party Talks on North Korea’s nuclear program and actively assisted convincing North Korea, in the Joint Statement of September 19, 2005, to commit to complete and verifiable dismantlement of all nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China also cooperated with the U.S. on public health issues, like SARS and the avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooperation on these transnational issues was issue-specific, pragmatic, and often insulated from political tensions. Indeed, even during periods of rivalry, functional cooperation persisted when interests overlapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opportunities to Further Enhance Bilateral Cooperation for the Common Good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although U.S. – China cooperation on counternarcotics is ongoing, specifically regarding the fentanyl crisis, trafficking in cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines also requires close attention. More can be done to enhance bilateral efforts on nuclear nonproliferation, starting with China agreeing to have a dialogue with the U.S. on China’s ambitious nuclear program. Extremist militant groups like ISIS continue to be active, thus requiring better cooperation on counterterrorism. Covid-19 was a wakeup call: there needs to be meaningful cooperation on pandemics. And ensuring that the space domain is used only for peaceful purposes must be a priority, while also ensuring that there are acceptable guidelines for the lawful and moral use of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. – China cooperation today is more about preventing a catastrophe. The Belgrade Embassy bombing in 1999, when the U.S. accidentally bombed China’s embassy in Belgrade, killing three Chinese officials and the EP-3 incident of 2001, when a Chinese jet crashed into a U.S. reconnaissance plane, killing the Chinese pilot, and China detaining the U.S. crew in Hainan Island are two examples of incidents that could have spiraled out of control. Chinas initially refused to take the telephone calls from Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, both hoping to deescalate these tense developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

Stability in Northeast Asia and a nuclear North Korea, aligned with Russia and viewing the U.S. and South Korea as the enemies, should also be discussed, as well as nuclear nonproliferation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April summit between Messrs. Trump and Xi will be an opportunity to candidly discuss Taiwan and the South China Sea, to ensure we do not stumble into conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summit is also an opportunity to message to the world that the U.S. and China are working on a myriad of transnational issues for the common good of all countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The author is the former associate director of national intelligence.

      <title>The Biggest Questions About Venezuelan Oil</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have suggested that Donald Trump seized control of Venezuela’s oil reserves to boost profits for US refineries or to lower energy prices for American consumers by flooding the global market with crude. But this resource grab is most likely motivated by greed, as well as the desire to curb China’s access to energy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Coast Guard, Sovereignty, and Homeland Defense</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/coast-guard-sovereignty-and-homeland-defense</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION —&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. defense planning rests on the assumption that wars are fought abroad, by expeditionary forces, against defined adversaries. For decades, those assumptions held. But today, many of the most consequential security challenges facing the United States violate all three. They occur closer to home, below the threshold of armed conflict, and in domains where sovereignty is enforced incrementally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift has exposed a chronic mismatch between how the United States defines its defense priorities and how it allocates resources and respect. While defense discourse continues to stubbornly emphasize power projection and high-end conflict, many of today’s challenges revolve around the more modest and rote enforcement of U.S. territorial integrity and national sovereignty—functions that are vital to U.S. strategic objectives yet lack the optical prestige of winning wars abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the center of this gap between prestige and need is the U.S. Coast Guard, whose mission profile aligns directly with America’s most important strategic objectives—the enforcement of sovereignty and homeland defense—yet remains strategically undervalued because its work rarely resembles the celebrated and well-funded styles of conventional warfighting. In an era of increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/gray-zone-warfare&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;gray-zone&lt;/a&gt; competition and persistent coercion, the failure to properly appreciate the Coast Guard threatens real strategic fallout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third decade of the 21st century, U.S. defense planning remains heavily oriented toward expeditionary warfighting and high-end kinetic conflict. Budget conversations still revolve around Ford-class supercarriers, F-35 fighters, and A2/AD penetration. This orientation shapes not only force design and budget &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.usni.org/2026/01/15/billions-in-funding-helps-coast-guard-rapidly-implement-force-design-2028-modernization-efforts&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;allocations&lt;/a&gt;, but also institutional prestige and political capital. The services associated with visible combat power, with the Ford-class and the F-35, continue to dominate strategic discourse—even as many of the most persistent security challenges confronting the United States unfold close to home, in the gray-zone, without the need for fifth-generation air power or heavy armor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It’s never been more important to understand what’s happening in the world.

Power projection, forward presence, and deterrence abroad are important—but they are secondary functions derived from the primary purpose of homeland defense. Yet U.S. defense discourse often treats homeland defense as a background condition when it should be revered as the first priority. The result is a blind spot in how security resources are evaluated and allocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coast Guard operates at a unique point where law enforcement, military authority, and sovereign enforcement all converge. On any given day, the Coast Guard may board foreign-flagged vessels suspected of sanctions violations, police maritime borders against illicit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-u-s-coast-guards-quiet-drug-war-wins-amid-trumps-caribbean-strikes&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;trafficking&lt;/a&gt;, secure ports that underpin global supply chains, and maintain a persistent presence in contested spaces, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pacificarea.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/Arctic-District/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arctic&lt;/a&gt;, without inviting escalation. The Coast Guard is equipped to intercept illegal fishing fleets, escort commercial shipping through sensitive waterways, and assert jurisdiction in legally ambiguous areas. These activities rarely resemble traditional warfighting, they rarely result in a Hollywood blockbuster, and they can be accomplished without nuclear-powered submarines or intercontinental ballistic missiles. But these are not peripheral activities—they are arguably amongst the most important daily functions the U.S. military undertakes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinct among the military branches, the Coast Guard operates under a legal framework that is uniquely suited to today’s security environment. Under Title 14 status, the Coast Guard falls within the Department of Homeland Security, conducting law enforcement and regulatory missions on a daily basis. Yet, when needed, the service can transition to Title 10 status, under the Department of Defense, and operate as an armed service when required. This agility allows the Coast Guard to remain continuously engaged across the spectrum of competition, whether enforcing U.S. law in peacetime, managing escalation in gray-zone encounters, or integrating seamlessly into military operations. Few other elements of U.S. power can move so fluidly between legal regimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, despite such strategic relevance, the Coast Guard suffers from a persistent optical problem. U.S. defense culture has long privileged services and missions associated with visible, kinetic combat—those that lend themselves to clear narratives of victory, sacrifice, and heroism. The Coast Guard’s work rarely fits that cinematic mold. Its success is measured not in territory seized or targets destroyed, but in disruptions prevented, borders enforced, and crises that never materialize. Inherently quiet work with outcomes that reflect a force operating exactly as designed, although without generating institutional prestige or political support. In a system that rewards the loudest and the brightest, the Coast Guard’s quiet enforcement of sovereignty is easy to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

Specifically, persistent underinvestment in the Coast Guard weakens maritime domain awareness, reduces sustained presence in key waterways, and narrows the set of tools available to manage gray-zone competition. As adversaries increasingly rely on legal ambiguity, deniable actors, and incremental pressure to test U.S. resolve, gaps in enforcement become opportunities. In this environment, the absence of credible, continuous sovereignty enforcement invites probing behavior that becomes harder to deter over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocacy for the Coast Guard does not require reassigning prestige, or elevating one service at the expense of others. It is merely an argument for strategic alignment. If territorial integrity, sovereignty enforcement, and homeland defense are truly core national-security priorities, then the institutions most directly responsible for those missions should be treated accordingly. As competition increasingly unfolds in the gray-zone between peace and war, the United States will need forces designed not only to win conflicts—but to prevent them from starting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite political gridlock within countries and at global summits, climate change and ecological degradation are creating undeniable economic momentum. As renewables scale up, fossil fuels will become even less competitive; and as ecosystems degrade, markets will price in the risks and reward those who adapt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Fight Over the Fed</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/the-fight-over-the-fed</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US Federal Reserve’s independence is widely understood to be vital to the economy’s well-being, by insulating monetary policy from political imperatives. But, following the launch of a criminal investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell by President Donald Trump’s minions at the Department of Justice, it is hanging on by a thread.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By capturing his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolás Maduro, US President Donald Trump sought to project power abroad but instead exposed his own political vulnerability. Despite his promises to restore Venezuela’s oil industry, his overt resource grab is far more likely to fuel regional turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Fiction writing, commercial photography, radio, music, and – most ominously – journalism and legacy news outlets face a similar reckoning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the world’s population expected to reach ten billion by mid-century, agriculture must produce more with less – every season, everywhere.

Today's Fed should emulate Eccles – and so should the US Congress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
