      <title>Restoring Europe’s Social Contracts</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-dangerous-erosion-of-the-rule-of-law-in-europe-by-ana-palacio-2025-11</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since World War II, liberal democracies have built and sustained their social contracts on three mutually reinforcing pillars: freedom, prosperity, and the rule of law. If Europe is to thrive in the 21st century and continue to serve as a model of democratic values, it must reinvigorate all three.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sri Lanka’s Interest-Rate Trap</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sri-lanka-central-bank-must-lower-interest-rates-for-economic-recovery-by-arjun-jayadev-et-al-2025-11</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has inexplicably maintained high interest rates in a deflationary environment, which increases debt-service costs and suppresses economic activity. It must change course now, because austerity in the name of fiscal sustainability is self-defeating if it destroys the conditions for growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Illiberal World Order Is Here</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that Donald Trump's administration has explicitly rejected the international rules-based institutions and arrangements that America created after World War II, the very idea of an international order is no longer relevant. The world now belongs to illiberal regimes intent on pursuing their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The G20 Can No Longer Postpone Debt Relief</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea that Africa can finance the green transition while simultaneously spending huge sums on debt service is absurd. That is why the upcoming G20 summit in Johannesburg must end with a commitment to restructuring the liabilities of highly indebted countries, most of which are on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today’s massive and still-growing investments in AI and its accompanying infrastructure could well pay off like the internet did, following the investment boom of the late 1990s. But, for now, the gains from AI look more muted, and the macro downsides larger, than in the case of the dot-com bubble.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates recently argued that we should de-emphasize the existential threat posed by climate change in order to “put human welfare at the center of our climate strategies.” But how tolerant should we be of the risk of creating a climate that will be disastrous for human welfare for centuries to come?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the host of this year's UN Climate Change Conference, Brazil seeks to make COP30 the “COP of implementation.” Translating commitments into robust action should include providing indigenous peoples with direct access to predictable and sustainable finance, and treating them as equal partners, rather than as beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A century of credit-driven growth has left most economies dependent on banks that fund only the safest bets. By lowering the costs of disclosure, due diligence, and compliance, AI could open equity markets to the smaller, riskier firms that drive innovation and job creation, unlocking a new engine of sustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Surveys show that emerging economies’ populations are not only well aware of the opportunities AI creates, but also more optimistic about the technology than advanced-economy populations. They might not lead the way in building AI models, but they can use the technology to advance their economic- and social-development goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite a tumultuous year, markets continue to bet on American liquidity and growth. But while the outlook looks promising, the United States is systematically trading strategic advantages for tactical gains, and the costs are accumulating in ways that won’t become apparent until it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main factors contributing to food insecurity is conflict. Policymakers must start viewing agriculture as a strategic sector that not only sustains households, but also anchors fragile states, gives legitimacy to governments, and creates an opening for cooperation in an increasingly fragmented world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Critics and credit-rating agencies have been challenging the legitimacy of Afreximbank’s preferred creditor status. By casting doubt on the reliability of African institutions, they are threatening to undermine the continent's ability to build a sovereign financial architecture capable of supporting its structural transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Accountability for one’s actions is a bedrock principle of any society built on the rule of law. Yet while we understand human autonomy and the responsibilities that come with it, the workings of machine autonomy lie beyond our comprehension, making AI agents an obvious risk to democratic governance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Energy Transition Is Achievable in Emerging Markets</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/energy-transition-emerging-market-economies-is-affordable-by-rakesh-mohan-and-janak-raj-2025-11</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A decade or so ago, a consensus emerged that the energy transition would require massive amounts of capital. But, according to new research into high-emitting sectors in nine major emerging-market economies, power generation will require the least amount of climate finance to shift from fossil fuels to renewables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>China’s Rare-Earth Own Goal</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/belief-in-china-rare-earth-dominance-is-based-on-misunderstanding-by-daniel-gros-2025-11</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whereas the conventional wisdom holds that the US depends on Chinese rare earths, putting it at a severe geopolitical disadvantage, it is actually China that depends on the US (and others) for higher value-added rare-earth compounds. Any Chinese restrictions on rare-earth exports are thus likely to hurt China most of all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The current geopolitical environment is arguably not conducive to pursuing reparations for slavery and colonialism. But Africa and its diaspora in the Americas, the Caribbean, and Europe continue to make headway, with a focus not only on seeking financial compensation but also on ending racial discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
