      <title>Development Finance Must Shift Away from Aid</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/developing-countries-must-reduce-foreign-aid-dependence-by-justin-yifu-lin-and-yan-wang-2025-10</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As traditional donors slash foreign-aid budgets, developing countries must mobilize a broader range of financing sources. National development banks, sovereign wealth funds, debt swaps, and public-private partnerships can foster sustainable investment and help reduce energy poverty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Vulnerable Is China?</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/how-vulnerable-is-china</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may have delivered a kind of détente, after months of escalating tariff threats by the United States and retaliatory restrictions on rare-earth exports by China. While China had good reason to de-escalate the conflict with the US, however, it remains beset by political and economic weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump’s Pivot from Asia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After US President Donald Trump's trip to the region, one could be forgiven for concluding that the &quot;pivot to Asia&quot; begun when Barack Obama was in the White House has been replaced by a pivot to the Western Hemisphere. Needless to say, this is not the pivot America’s friends and allies in Asia were and are counting on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can China Catch Up with the US Economically?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With its GNI per capita having increased steadily in recent years, China has probably evaded the middle-income trap. But the country may yet find itself ensnared in a kind of economic Thucydides trap: attempting to surpass an incumbent hegemon bent on keeping it down – and never quite succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For centuries, the firm has organized economic life, translating human labor into value through hierarchy and routine. But as agentic AI begins to perform the managerial work of coordinating and decision-making, the institutions that once defined modern capitalism are starting to give way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the US Supreme Court upholds President Donald Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on US allies and adversaries alike, it will hand a loaded gun to future presidents. Why couldn't an administration use IEEPA tools to enforce a global minimum corporate tax or effectively ban crypto trading?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a book released earlier this year, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson argue essentially for “competent capacity”: a US that can effectively plan, approve, and execute projects. That is a worthy goal, but “abundance” is probably not the clearest way to convey it, let alone the most effective means of achieving it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new report shows that the integration of climate objectives and social-protection systems can go a long way toward delivering finance where it is needed most. But making the most of these findings will require a new approach to designing, financing, and implementing social-protection programs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The costs of decarbonizing the four highest-emitting sectors in China dwarf those in other major emerging economies, with India coming in a distant second. But while the figures might seem daunting, they are well within reach for China, which should be able to meet its own climate-finance needs relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While most people regard the Sino-American rivalry as a new cold war between two world-bestriding giants, the truth is that both countries are tightly constrained. Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping each sense the other side's vulnerabilities, which means they cannot hide their own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To rebuild the middle class, reduce global poverty, and address climate change simultaneously, we need to depart from established ways of thinking and consider new approaches.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Western leaders favor the language of “polycrisis” because it obscures the root cause of our current predicament: the industrial-colonial paradigm. Instead of focusing on fear, the world must study and tackle development challenges with a purposeful realism that draws on the creativity of a genuinely global community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Russians were promised a quick victory in Ukraine; instead, they have gotten a protracted and costly conflict reminiscent of the Afghan quagmire that contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the absence of political will, the law has become a crucial driver of climate progress.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When millions of protesters came out this month to say, “No Kings,” Donald Trump posted an AI-generated video of himself being crowned, only to insist, the next day, that he is not a king.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At a time when developing countries are under fiscal pressure and struggling to invest in future growth, the United States could come to the rescue – and without putting one cent of its own money on the line. Rarely has there been a better moment for a new issuance of the International Monetary Fund's global reserve asset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The only conclusion to draw is that they are willing to chase short-term profits even if it means funding a repressive regime that has made no secret of its animosity toward the West.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the US Federal Trade Commission freed millions of Americans from a powerful constraint on their labor-market mobility by banning non-compete clauses for most workers. It was one of the biggest policy wins for American workers in recent years – and, because of Donald Trump's administration, it may never take effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Western countries have been generous in supporting Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, their financial assistance can be used only for non-military purposes.

Success will require progress on four fronts, all of which will be addressed at COP30.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Europe’s competitiveness concerns are understandable, inaction on social and environmental challenges also carries high economic costs.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite all the enthusiasm for AI, which has undoubtedly demonstrated impressive capabilities, the signal from bond markets suggests that investors are unconvinced that the technology will generate sustained or widespread growth, let alone a more extreme positive or negative outcome. What accounts for this disconnect?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
