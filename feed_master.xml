      <description>&lt;p&gt;Women comprise the majority of workers in more than half of the 40 occupations that are most at risk of displacement by AI.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Washington Consensus assumed that economic growth would automatically follow market liberalization. That belief has not aged well, and a new policy approach must include innovation, good jobs, climate stability, gender equality, and a state empowered to provide effective regulation and high-quality public services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the host of this year's UN Climate Change Conference, Brazil seeks to make COP30 the “COP of implementation.” Translating commitments into robust action should include providing indigenous peoples with direct access to predictable and sustainable finance, and treating them as equal partners, rather than as beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A century of credit-driven growth has left most economies dependent on banks that fund only the safest bets.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Japan's first female prime minister, Takaichi Sanae, has come to power at a critical moment for Japan. If she is to be the leader the country needs, she will have to deliver on three fronts: reining in inflation, increasing female labor-force participation, and navigating a fraught geopolitical environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heading into this month's United Nations Climate Conference, evidence is mounting that the Global North will not meet its funding promises. But rich countries could still demonstrate good faith through another form of solidarity: sharing the knowledge, technology, and intellectual property that underpin the green transition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A decade or so ago, a consensus emerged that the energy transition would require massive amounts of capital. But, according to new research into high-emitting sectors in nine major emerging-market economies, power generation will require the least amount of climate finance to shift from fossil fuels to renewables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whereas the conventional wisdom holds that the US depends on Chinese rare earths, putting it at a severe geopolitical disadvantage, it is actually China that depends on the US (and others) for higher value-added rare-earth compounds. Any Chinese restrictions on rare-earth exports are thus likely to hurt China most of all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Japan’s first female prime minister, Takaichi Sanae, presents herself as a leader who can be tougher than the men. This, combined with her hawkish views on immigration and defense, suggests that Takaichi will not use her position to help other women crack the glass ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adam Smith favored neither state socialism nor unbridled markets, but something subtler: a moral economy grounded in sympathy and the pursuit of human flourishing. In a world where markets look increasingly unmoored from ethics, we could do worse than to revisit what the &quot;founding father&quot; of economics actually wrote.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While many commentators have criticized Argentine President Javier Milei's draconian approach to economic reform, the results of the October legislative election show that the Argentine people would prefer short-term economic pain over a return to Peronist policies.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US airstrikes in the Caribbean reflect President Donald Trump’s view of intra-American relations as hierarchical.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The belief that members of political dynasties are uniquely suited to lead is woven deeply into the fabric of Indian governance, from village councils to the highest echelons of parliament. But when elected office is treated like a family heirloom, the quality of governance inevitably suffers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is training the press and the American people to associate the military strikes on small boats in international waters with stopping the flow of fentanyl and other drugs. This mendacity is a prime example of the falsehoods that imperialists tell before launching doomed wars of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may have delivered a kind of détente, after months of escalating tariff threats by the United States and retaliatory restrictions on rare-earth exports by China. While China had good reason to de-escalate the conflict with the US, however, it remains beset by political and economic weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After US President Donald Trump's trip to the region, one could be forgiven for concluding that the &quot;pivot to Asia&quot; begun when Barack Obama was in the White House has been replaced by a pivot to the Western Hemisphere. Needless to say, this is not the pivot America’s friends and allies in Asia were and are counting on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can China Catch Up with the US Economically?</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-will-avoid-the-middle-income-trap-but-fail-to-outgrow-the-us-economy-by-keun-lee-2025-10</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With its GNI per capita having increased steadily in recent years, China has probably evaded the middle-income trap. But the country may yet find itself ensnared in a kind of economic Thucydides trap: attempting to surpass an incumbent hegemon bent on keeping it down – and never quite succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the US Supreme Court upholds President Donald Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on US allies and adversaries alike, it will hand a loaded gun to future presidents. Why couldn't an administration use IEEPA tools to enforce a global minimum corporate tax or effectively ban crypto trading?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a book released earlier this year, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson argue essentially for “competent capacity”: a US that can effectively plan, approve, and execute projects. That is a worthy goal, but “abundance” is probably not the clearest way to convey it, let alone the most effective means of achieving it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new report shows that the integration of climate objectives and social-protection systems can go a long way toward delivering finance where it is needed most.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The costs of decarbonizing the four highest-emitting sectors in China dwarf those in other major emerging economies, with India coming in a distant second. But while the figures might seem daunting, they are well within reach for China, which should be able to meet its own climate-finance needs relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
