      <title>The Reality is that Russia is Signaling Minimal Desire for Peace</title>

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/a-man-looks-at-a-damaged-residential-building-in-kyiv-ukraine-after-a-massive-drone-and-missile-attack-by-russia-jan-9-2026.jpg?id=62804849&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C53%2C0%2C54&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP DIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;As Russia continues it's brutal bombardment of Ukrainian cities, talks between Moscow and the U.S. to end the war appear on very different trajectories.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;White House envoy Steve Witkoff is reportedly planning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-14/witkoff-and-kushner-seek-to-visit-moscow-for-putin-meeting-soon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another trip&lt;/a&gt; to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as Moscow's winter attacks continue unabated.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, Russia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russian-missiles-strike-kyiv-one-dead-kharkiv-ukrainian-officials-say-2026-01-12/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles on cities across Ukraine, killing at least four people and striking critical energy and heat infrastructure. In the capital, Kyiv, residents are facing temperatures as low as 10 degrees farenheit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/major-russian-strike-targets-ukraines-power-grid-in-freezing-temperatures&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;without electricity or water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 30, 2025, Moscow claimed a Ukrainian drone attack targeted Russian President Vladimir Putin's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/29/europe/russia-claim-ukrainian-drone-attack-putin-residence-intl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;residence&lt;/a&gt;. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov threatened his country's military would launch &quot;retaliatory strikes&quot; and said Moscow's &quot;negotiating position will be revised” in ongoing talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected the claimed drone attack as “a complete fabrication”, and sources say the CIA assessed that Ukraine was not targeting the Russian leader's residence in the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump said in December that the U.S. was “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-meet-trump-florida-talks-ukraine-peace-plan-2025-12-28/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;very close&lt;/a&gt;” to a deal. So, what's happening?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the latest push for peace, Russia seems to conveniently reset the clock, demanding further talks as it continues its bombardments and assaults across Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This Russian strike sends an extremely clear signal about Russia’s priorities,” Zelensky said in a post &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/2003378962714497042&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; referring to a strike on December 23 that killed three people and injured 12. Zeleneky condemned the attack “ahead of Christmas, when people simply want to be with their families, at home, and safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That strike came just days after Putin told Russian defense ministry officials that Moscow will persist in its mission to “liberate its historic lands” and achieve its war goals “&lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/in-further-disregard-for-peace-putin-calls-european-leaders-little-pigs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;unconditionally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” — by negotiations for an agreement in Moscow’s favor, or through continued war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The continued Russian attacks and Putin’s bellicose language underscore a pattern that has defined Russia’s position on “peace” throughout its full-scale invasion of Ukraine: not budging from maximalist demands, blaming Kyiv for the lack of progress, and leveraging Western fears of escalation to World War Three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardline from Putin comes as Ukraine has offered significant concessions, including Ukraine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-demands-dignified-peace-us-ukraine-officials-meet-berlin-2025-12-14/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;dropping NATO membership ambitions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for at least the time being, as well as a potential withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the east and the creation of a demilitarized “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;free economic zone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” The latest reports say Russia still wants more, including more stringent restrictions on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-24/russia-to-demand-changes-to-us-peace-plan-seen-as-starting-point?srnd=homepage-americas&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;size of Ukraine’s military&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Ukrainians have been saying for over a year that they are ready to come to an agreement. They are ready to be realistic and compromise,” Glenn Corn, a former senior CIA Officer told &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s the Russians that are not doing that. It’s the Russians that continue to push maximalist demands and that continue to scuttle the peace process — not the Ukrainians.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the eyes of seasoned intelligence professionals who have studied Putin's actions for decades, the continued attacks despite peace talks are hardly surprising. “Putin has never been sincere about a negotiated solution to his ‘Special Military Operation,’” said Rob Dannenberg, former Chief of CIA’s Central Eurasia Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia is also continuing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0k4389g2o&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;offensive pushes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on multiple fronts, including in the regions it claimed to annex - Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk, where the embattled strategic city of Pokrovsk is - as well as in the northern Kharkiv region. Experts warn Putin’s ambitions go far beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We've got Putin on the other side of it and the reality is he has not taken one single step towards a temporary ceasefire or a peace deal whatsoever,” General Jack Keane (Ret.), who served as Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army and is a trusted advisor to President Donald Trump, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Where he is, he still believes that eventually he's going to break the will and resolve of the United States and the Europeans and the Zelensky government and he will eventually have his way here,” Keane said, adding that Putin’s ultimate war goal is to “topple the government of Ukraine and expand into Eastern Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

The pattern was visible in Georgia in 2008 and again in Crimea in 2014, when Moscow signaled willingness to talk even as it consolidated military gains on the ground, buying time and weakening Western responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always use the example of Syria during the Civil War when they [Russian forces] were killing members of the Syrian opposition while they were drinking wine and coffee with American and European interlocutors in Europe, claiming that they were trying to find an agreement,” Corn told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, behind any Russian statement of openness to engagement and dialogue, Putin has continued to assert that Ukraine is part of Russia, that the government of Zelensky is illegitimate, and that Russian forces can achieve victory on the battlefield to justify his stonewalling — despite mounting costs for Russia and limited territorial gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“Putin’s strategy has been consistent: advance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-narratives-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;false narratives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; adopt a non-negotiable maximalist position and make ever-increasing demands for concessions; take deliberate actions to erode U.S., Ukrainian, and NATO resolve and perceived options; employ implicit and explicit threats and intimidation; and offer false choices,” former CIA Senior Executive Dave Pitts&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Taken together, these represent Russian ‘reflexive control’—a subset of cognitive warfare and a strategy designed to persuade adversaries to voluntarily adopt outcomes favorable to Russia,” Pitts told us. “In the face of unreasonable sovereignty and territorial demands placed on Ukraine and none placed on Russia, an emboldened and confident Putin will now likely demand even more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Hesitant West&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did we get here? Some experts say a long-running pattern of Western hesitation in keeping Russia in check has emboldened Moscow. It’s not hard to remember that at the start of the full-scale invasion, Western countries were slow to provide full military support to Ukraine, concerned about a possible wider escalation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retired General Philip Breedlove, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/breedlove-middle-east-ukraine-authoritarians&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “We have taken precious little action to stop the fight in Ukraine and we still find ourselves saying, ‘We're not going to do that because we've got to give peace a chance and we don't want to escalate the problem.’ And that formula is not working now and has not worked for 11 years.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have virtually enabled the Russian war on Ukraine by our lack of action in a more severe way. Many of us from military backgrounds say that we have built sanctuary for Russia. From that sanctuary, we allow them to attack Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that while the goal should be, as President Donald Trump has said, “to stop the killing,” awarding concessions to a Kremlin that has yet to drop its maximalist war aims is not the solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Trump Administration’s desire to end the violence in Ukraine is commendable, but not at the price of setting the stage for the next war by giving victory to the aggressor,” Dannenberg told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-peace-deal&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With peace talks ongoing, it is proving difficult to come up with a deal that does not force Ukraine to give too much while ensuring the proposal does not push Russia to reject the deal outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beyond the negotiating table, experts say there are ways to pressure Putin to peace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is not waiting, continuing strikes on Russian energy infrastructure to curb energy export revenues that fund Moscow’s war machine, and bringing the cost of the war back to ordinary Russians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the U.S. and Europe, major sanctions on Russia - including new measures against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/do-oil-sanctions-still-work&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Russian oil giants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Rosneft and Lukoil - are already in place and reportedly starting to take their toll, but experts say stronger enforcement is needed to make them truly bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining military aid to Ukraine is also essential. In mid-December, Congress passed a defense bill that authorizes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-congress-passes-massive-defense-bill-that-includes-support-ukraine-europe-2025-12-17/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;$800 million for Ukraine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - $400 million in each of the next two years - as part of the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which pays U.S. companies to produce weapons for Ukraine's military. President Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/trump-ndaa-military-spending&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;signed the measure into law&lt;/a&gt; on December 18. Meanwhile, while Europeans failed to agree to use frozen Russian assets to back a loan for Ukraine, the EU agreed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/12/23/exclusive-how-the-deal-to-get-ukraine-a-90-billion-eu-loan-was-sealed&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;90 billion euro loan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the next two years, backed by the bloc’s budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Trump Administration should demonstrate its displeasure at Russia’s clear disregard for any so-called peace process by fully enforcing all existing sanctions, providing Ukraine with long-range weapons, and declaring that peace negotiations are suspended until Russia demonstrates it is serious about these negotiations,&quot; General Ben Hodges, former Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe, told &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;. &quot;Otherwise, the President’s efforts and those of his negotiators are clearly a waste of time and headed nowhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European countries have also fortified post-war pledges to Ukraine. Britain and France have committed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17zee20qpzo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sending troops&lt;/a&gt; to a peacekeeping mission -- if a peace deal is reached. Experts U.S. intelligence, command and control, and logistics support is needed to give any European effort credibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact will be felt far beyond Ukraine, and long after the guns there go silent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the United States, the best outcome will come from taking the longer, harder road that denies any reward for Russia’s illegal invasion, forces Putin to make reasonable concessions, and sustains the long-term sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,” Pitts said. “That longer, harder road also leads to stronger U.S. national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vladimir Putin also appeared to reject any progress in ceasefire discussions. “The strategic initiative is completely &lt;a href=&quot;https://semafor.com/s/o4pNCpPAYG?email=emasucol@thecipherbrief.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;in the hands of the Russian forces,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Putin said that Russia is facing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/putin-admits-russia-faces-gas-shortage-amid-ukraines-strikes-on-energy-infrastructure/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gas shortage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While he did not say why, the comment notably came amid Ukraine’s campaign to target Russian refineries, pipelines and other energy infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what could be seen as tacit support for Ukraine’s tactic, the Trump administration recently approved an $825 million sale of extended-range missiles to Ukraine. The State Department said this includes 3,350 &lt;a href=&quot;https://aviationweek.com/defense/missile-defense-weapons/us-innovation-hurries-new-cruise-missile-ukraine&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ERAM missiles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which have a range of 250 miles, and 3,350 GPS units, missile containers, and other necessary equipment. The package is funded via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_237131.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;financing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;some help&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from U.S. foreign military financing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, there is stalwart support for Ukraine, with around 26 countries of the so-called Coalition of the Willing committing last week to sending troops to Ukraine or training the Ukrainian military to help guarantee Ukraine’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-witkoff-europe-61ae60275a00cb442c743181df13b785&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;postwar security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, of course, there is the option for the U.S. to act on its threat of sanctions if Russia does not move to an equitable peace deal. President Trump said on Sunday he is ready to move to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-ready-phase-two-russia-sanctions-over-ukraine-conflict-2025-09-07/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;second phase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of sanctions on Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. President has threatened Russia with ‘crushing’ sanctions. But Putin played ‘rope-a-dope’ and instead got a summit and postponement of sanctions for his efforts,” Dannenberg said. “President Trump has now set another deadline. The time for deadlines is over. It is time for action. … Let Ukraine take the war to the Russian Federation and make it visible to the people of Russia what is happening. If Putin doesn’t like it, let him end the war and withdraw from Ukrainian territory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Such killings now, when real diplomacy could have already begun long ago, are a deliberate crime and a prolongation of the war,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on social media after the latest Kyiv strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mounting Frustration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;President Trump has expressed frustration with this charade from the Kremlin, especially given his investment in efforts to broker a peace deal. The U.S. President has complained that he is “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/russias-largest-drone-attack-yet-hits-ukraine-government-building-4e3e46d4?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgmZUuKDUlv7RNaF5WdtLC5o3pi80OQ7eE_4JFmCs9sizo496xuhQTnrl92Ogs%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=68bdb7fb&amp;amp;gaa_sig=thIkQFWy26_u46aZW3ZQ6ovaIk1DwWYgJP2soa4mnbhmTcojk1NYSoRt7VhZG7uYcrEFQd9yaKJs3uYonpEWkQ%3D%3D&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;very disappointed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;” in Putin since he “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/video/trump-says-putin-talks-nice-and-then-he-bombs-everybody-b085000bd3bb4847837a5349204a7315&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;talks nice and then he bombs everybody&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;After the August 28 strikes on Kyiv, White House press secretary &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Karoline Leavitt &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;said Trump “was &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/28/trump-shrugs-off-russias-assault-on-kyiv-and-europes-outrage-00534585&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;not happy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt; about this move, but he was also not surprised.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leavitt noted: “These are two countries that have been at war for a very long time. Russia launched this attack on Kyiv, and likewise, Ukraine recently dealt a blow to Russia’s oil refineries.” That was in reference to the recent spate of Ukrainian drone attacks at Russian &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/27/frustrated-russians-grapple-with-fuel-crisis-as-ukraine-attacks-oil-refineries&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;oil and gas infrastructure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. The difference there, experts say, is that Ukraine is targeting energy infrastructure to curb the revenues of Russia’s energy exports, which fuel its war machine. Russia has been striking Ukrainian infrastructure throughout the war, in addition to bombing Ukrainian civilians.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia on Sunday struck Ukraine with the largest aerial assault of the war so far. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched over 800 drones and fired 13 missiles in the attack, marking the most drones used against Ukraine in a single night. The bombardment killed at least five people across Ukraine and struck a landmark government building in Kyiv, Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers, for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This attack is just the latest in a series of Russian assaults. On August 28, Russian drones and missiles &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-attack-23e051f1b7e93308f99b6fdfdd8949f2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;leveled a residential tower&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3y7m2gz0o&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;damaged European Union diplomatic offices&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Kyiv.

Meanwhile, Russia has pushed further on the frontlines, entering the central Dnipropetrovsk region for the first time in the war. Russian Defense Minister &lt;strong&gt;Andrei Belousov &lt;/strong&gt;claimed that the Russian army has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-defence-minister-says-his-forces-have-sped-up-rate-their-advance-ukraine-2025-08-29/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;accelerated its rate of advance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relentless assault is nothing new to Ukraine, but what makes the most recent attacks stand out is that they come amid a major U.S. and European push for peace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 16, President Trump hosted Putin in Alaska to discuss how to end the fighting.

He considers Ukraine part of Russia and Zelensky illegitimate. So with whom should he negotiate in his mind? Putin is even less inclined to negotiate since he has come to believe (incorrectly in my view) that he can win the war militarily. He allows the pretense of negotiation to create confusion and distraction in supporters of Ukraine in the West. Thereby, delaying military and economic support for Ukraine. By and large this strategy has worked thus far. Anchorage and its aftermath should have provided clarity that Putin is insincere about negotiations with Ukraine. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RALPH GOFF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The increased intensity of Russia strikes on cities across Ukraine - the Ukrainians recorded nearly 600 drones and 31 missiles of various types during the night of 27-28 August - clearly indicate Vladimir Putin has no real interest in agreeing to a ceasefire at present. Meanwhile, Russian ground forces literally inching their way forward in numerous sectors of the front- albeit at tremendous human cost - reportedly now of over 1,000,000 Russian soldiers killed, captured or seriously wounded ( by comparison around 15,000 Soviet Soldiers were killed in a decade of war in Afghanistan) - clearly indicate that Putin is not overly concerned with losses to Russia. Thus, it's hard to predict where Putin is going with this. At best he is &quot; softening up&quot; the Ukrainian people so that they will be increasingly eager for a settlement - any settlement - to the war. At worst he is firmly set on destroying Ukraine militarily, economically and politically no matter the cost. Meanwhile, neither the US administration nor our European Allies have developed and presented a cogent strategy for either continuing the war or seeking an armistice. Putin, who has never really been held accountable by any US administration or by the Europeans , has no real reason to stop at this time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLEN CORN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They will continue to launch strikes, try and take territory while they're going to a negotiation negotiating table. So they've done that. The tactic they've used in the past, and I always use the example of Syria during the Civil War when they were killing members of the Syrian opposition while they were drinking wine and coffee with American and European interlocutors in Europe, claiming that they were trying to find an agreement.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damage to Ukraine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United Nations currently estimates that as of 31 December 2024, the total cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine is $524 billion (€506 billion) over the next decade, which is approximately 2.8 times the estimated nominal GDP of Ukraine for 2024.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/02/25/updated-ukraine-recovery-and-reconstruction-needs-assessment-released?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/02/25/updated-ukraine-recovery-and-reconstruction-needs-assessment-released?utm_source=chatgpt.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/10/concern-ukraine-will-be-split-up-reconstruction-talks?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/10/concern-ukraine-will-be-split-up-reconstruction-talks?utm_source=chatgpt.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than three years into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the war has already inflicted over $175 billion in direct damage to the country’s buildings and infrastructure, according to the latest estimates from the World Bank. This marks a $23 billion increase in damage compared to the previous year’s assessment. The data comes from the fourth Ukraine Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA4), which covers the period from February 24, 2022, to December 31, 2024.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/chart/34614/estimated-cost-of-direct-war-damage-in-ukraine/?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.statista.com/chart/34614/estimated-cost-of-direct-war-damage-in-ukraine/?utm_source=chatgpt.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part of problem: Western inaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breedlove&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remain deterred. In the press you hear people talking about this war being three and a half years long. This war is over 11 years long. It started in the spring of '14 when I was still serving as the Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, and it hasn't stopped. It was hot for a few years and then it went warm. Russians were killing Ukrainians and Ukrainians were killing Russians on the line of contact. And then, after some six years or so of that warm war on the line of contact, Russia re-invaded, and I call this the third phase of the 11-year-long war.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This war has covered four presidents, Obama, Trump twice and Biden once, and all four of them have been nearly and completely deterred from the very beginning. We, as we always do in the military, offered options for how to address this conflict in Ukraine back in 2014. And the answer was, &quot;We're not going to take any action because the war will escalate if we take action.&quot; Well, we gave them options from very small movements to larger more bellicose movements, they chose none of them and here we are. What we do know is we did not take action for fear of escalation. We were deterred and we didn't take action and Russia escalated anyway. And so our lack of action ended up in the escalation of the problem by the Russians. And that has repeated itself through four administrations for the past 11 years. We are still deterred. We have taken precious little action to stop the fight in Ukraine and we still find ourselves saying, &quot;We're not going to do that because we've got to give peace a chance and we don't want to escalate the problem.&quot; And that formula is not working now and has not worked for 11 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have virtually enabled the Russian war on Ukraine by our lack of action in a more severe way. Many of us from military backgrounds say that we have built sanctuary for Russia. From that sanctuary, we allow them to attack Ukraine. If you can think of a map, up in the northwest corner of the map is Belarus all the way to the east around through Russia all the way to the south, into the Black Sea and west across the Black Sea. We have allowed Russia to attack Ukraine from nearly 300 degrees on the map, and we still cannot determine that we should allow Ukraine to fire back deeply into Russia with our kit.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution: pressure on Russia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;““So what does this mean for the US and for Europe? I think this now, it's just a sign that, I mean, I've said this before, I've written it. I give President Trump a lot of credit for trying to find a solution for this very serious problem. But I think now is the time where the only thing that Putin is going to understand, and the only way that he will stop doing what he's doing is if he feels pain.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“He understands that there is a serious consequence for him and the people around him for what he is doing, and the only thing that's going to make him be anything close to sincere is when he understands that he's dealing with interlocutors that are very serious and that are willing to stand up and respond forcefully for this type of aggressive action, which is insulting to those people, including our president, who have tried to negotiate a ceasefire and a peace agreement.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanctions, ukraine air defenses, kick out children of russian oligarchs studying in us, london, paris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DANNENBERG:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The U.S. President has threatened Russia with “crushing” sanctions. But Putin played “rope-a-dope” and instead got a summit and postponement of sanctions for his efforts. President Trump has now set another deadline. The time for deadlines is over. It is time for action. The only path that has not been tried (but has only been threatened) is to put maximum pressure on Putin and the Russian Federation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how we get there: first, the President should immediately authorize the advancement of pending legislation in the U.S. Congress on sanctions on Russia and purchasers of Russian hydrocarbon products.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, the President should use his authority to advance the sale or “lend lease” of military support for Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, the U.S. should remove any restrictions on Ukrainian use of weapons systems already provided or already committed to help Ukraine defend itself. Let Ukraine take the war to the Russian Federation and make it visible to the people of Russia what is happening. If Putin doesn’t like it, let him end the war and withdraw from Ukrainian territory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And fourth, the U.S. should restore maximum diplomatic isolation of Russia and publicly call out Russia as the aggressor in this conflict.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this context, the success President Trump had ending the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict should be leveraged to reduce Russian influence in the Republic of Georgia, long a bastion of pro-U.S. sentiment but recently put under a cloud of Russian interference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let the loss of influence in the Caucasus be added to the list of Putin’s strategic failures. Put it on the list right next to Finland and Sweden joining NATO.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanctions alone won’t influence Putin, but sanctions, renewed military and financial support for Ukraine, renewed diplomatic isolation, and strategic leverage on Russia’s periphery might.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The path ahead should be clear to the U.S. President, who must now know that he can’t trust Putin. The Russian president is the enemy of the U.S. in every fiber of his being and it’s time for him to pay the price of his folly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breedlove&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanctions have never changed Putin's actions on the battlefield. Sanctions have hurt Russia. Sanctions have hurt the Russian people. Sanctions have hurt the Russian economy. All those things are true, but they have never changed Russian actions on the battlefield. And so, we either need to double and triple the really crushing sanctions and take all of the frozen Russian money and use it to help Ukraine. We've got to physically stop the Russian shadow fleet from moving oil around the world. There's a whole host of things we could do that would truly bring Russia to their knees and we haven't done it.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note on security guarantees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breedlove: “It's a confusing issue about what America is going to do or not do in any possible peace-enforcement capacity. The best move right now, not under a NATO hat, because clearly, Mr. Putin believes he's in charge and he said there will be no NATO involvement, but if NATO or European Union nations were to volunteer for a coalition of the willing presence in Ukraine, then that's what, I think, needs to happen. We need the big nations- the UK, the French, the Germans, to step up but they're waiting and watching for American leadership. Is America going to be that backbone and offer what the president talked about in his post-talk news conference and so forth? We need for all of that to happen. We need for America to make a decision to supply air power, command and control, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, et cetera, those non-boots on the ground capabilities. And then, we need the European nations who've already intimated they may be willing to provide boots on the ground to get in there and get a stoppage of the fighting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Putin’s entire objective however is to keep kicking the can to the right, run right up to the red line, wave a bright shiny object, get another red line, run right up to the red line, wave another shiny object, get another deadline. He is very good and has had great success at moving our red lines to the right.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FROM THE UKRAINIAN EMBASSY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the night of August 28 (starting from 19:30 on August 27), the enemy launched a massive strike on the territory of Ukraine using attack UAVs, air-launched and ground-launched missiles – a total of &lt;strong&gt;629 aerial attack assets&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;598 Shahed-type attack UAVs&lt;/strong&gt; and decoy drones of various types launched from Kursk, Bryansk, Millerovo, Orel, Shatalovo, Primorsko-Akhtarsk (Russia), and Hvardiiske (temporarily occupied Crimea);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Kh-47M2 &quot;Kinzhal&quot; aero-ballistic missiles&lt;/strong&gt; from the airspace of Lipetsk and Voronezh regions (Russia);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles&lt;/strong&gt; from Bryansk and Voronezh regions (Russia);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 Kh-101 cruise missiles&lt;/strong&gt; from the airspace of Saratov region (Russia).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;main target of the Russian strike was Kyiv&lt;/strong&gt;, where the majority of drones and missiles were directed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Odesa region, due to missile threats and the “transit” flight of Shahed groups, the first air raid alert lasted from &lt;strong&gt;23:00 to 01:18&lt;/strong&gt;. The second alert was from &lt;strong&gt;03:52 to 06:02&lt;/strong&gt; – exactly when the Russians launched aero-ballistic, ballistic, and cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to preliminary data, as of 09:00, Ukrainian air defense forces shot down/suppressed &lt;strong&gt;589 aerial targets&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;563 Shahed-type UAVs&lt;/strong&gt; and decoy drones of various types;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Kh-47M2 &quot;Kinzhal&quot; aero-ballistic missile&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 Kh-101 cruise missiles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall effectiveness of air defense is estimated at &lt;strong&gt;approximately 93%&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Against Shaheds – &lt;strong&gt;94%&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overall against missiles – &lt;strong&gt;83%&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Against cruise missiles – &lt;strong&gt;90%&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Against ballistic and aero-ballistic missiles – &lt;strong&gt;72%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy on “X”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as our people are dealing with the consequences of one of the most large-scale Russian terrorist attacks, we see yet another attempt by Hungarian officials to portray black as white and to shift the blame for the ongoing war onto Ukraine. In Ukraine, we responded positively to all proposals from the world regarding a ceasefire and real diplomacy, and the only one who rebuffed them was Russia. Unfortunately, there has still been no fair reaction from Hungary to such behavior by Russia. Nor has there even been sympathy expressed over the deaths of our people – just last night alone, in Kyiv, Russian drones and missiles took the lives of 17 people, including 4 children. Yet every day we hear new accusations against Ukraine coming from Hungary. Hungarian officials have gone so far as to attempt to discriminate against members of the Hungarian community in Ukraine for their participation in the defense of our state and our people. If Hungary has indeed closed entry into Hungary and the entire Schengen zone to one of Ukraine’s military commanders, who is an ethnic Hungarian and a citizen of Ukraine, this can only cause outrage. I have instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to clarify all the facts and respond accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1961047854639935814&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1961047854639935814&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now in Kyiv, first responders are clearing the rubble of an ordinary residential building after a Russian strike. Another massive attack against our cities and communities. Killings again. Tragically, at least 8 people have already been confirmed dead. One of them is a child. My condolences to all their families and loved ones. People may still be trapped under the rubble. Dozens are wounded. These Russian missiles and attack drones today are a clear response to everyone in the world who, for weeks and months, has been calling for a ceasefire and for real diplomacy. Russia chooses ballistics instead of the negotiating table. It chooses to continue killing instead of ending the war. And this means that Russia still does not fear the consequences. Russia still takes advantage of the fact that at least part of the world turns a blind eye to murdered children and seeks excuses for Putin. We expect a reaction from China to what is going on. China has repeatedly called for not expanding the war and for a ceasefire. Yet this is not happening because of Russia. We expect a reaction from Hungary. The death of children should definitely stir far greater emotions than anything else. We expect a response from everyone in the world who has called for peace but now more often stays silent rather than taking principled positions. And it is definitely time for new, tough sanctions against Russia for everything it is doing. All deadlines have already been broken, dozens of opportunities for diplomacy ruined. Russia must feel accountable for every strike, for every day of this war. Eternal memory to all victims of Russia!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1960934028321685907&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1960934028321685907&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prime minister of Ukraine Yulia Svyrydenko on “X”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of now, already 14 people are known to have been killed as a result of the Russian attack, including 3 children. The horrific and deliberate killing of civilians, again. The Russians are not choosing to end the war, only constant expansion of atrocities. Overnight in Kyiv, dozens of buildings were hit: residential houses, office centers, civilian enterprises. Among them also the building where the European Union Delegation to Ukraine is located. Russians now believe that they have paralyzed Ukraine's allies with feigned plans for &quot;negotiations&quot; and endless delays that only serve as methods to buy time with the true goal only of preventing sanctions. It is crucial now that the world responds firmly. Russia must be stopped. New and stronger sanctions are needed. The Russians understand only strength and pressure. For every strike, Moscow must feel the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/Svyrydenko_Y/status/1960995612989563198&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/Svyrydenko_Y/status/1960995612989563198&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/u&gt;There are currently over 500 rescue workers and 1,000 police officers engaged in rescue efforts across Kyiv in the aftermath of yet another brutal Russian missile and drone attack on our capital city. With the possibility that the death toll may still rise, there are already at least 8 confirmed dead – among them 1 kid – and dozens injured after an assault that lasted more than nine hours. Russians targeted residential buildings, shopping areas, a school: purely civilian targets. Russia has merely used the good intentions of Ukraine's allies to buy more time, to expand the killing – simply mass murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/Svyrydenko_Y/status/1960936422937858118&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/Svyrydenko_Y/status/1960936422937858118&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Andrii Sybiha on “X”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the barbaric Russian strike on the Ukrainian capital, it was important to visit, together with heads of 55 foreign diplomatic missions, the site of one of the strikes, a ruined residential building in the Darnytskyi district. This is a site of a horrible war crime. At least 14 innocent civilians were killed by Russian terrorists here, including four children. One of the kids was born under Russian strikes in 2022 and killed by the Russian strike this morning. I am grateful to my colleague, Minister of Internal Affairs Igor Klymenko, who briefed foreign diplomats on the casualties and recovery efforts. It is critical that the world sees Russian terror and takes action to stop this barbarism. I thank all foreign diplomats who joined us today in commemorating the victims of Russian strikes. Russia is a terrorist state. We count on strong international responses and action to increase pressure on Russia, including new tough sanctions, and strengthen support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1961010371046834689&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1961010371046834689&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We insist on strong international reactions to Russia’s brutal strike on Kyiv and other cities. Russia killed at least 8 people, including a child, and targeted civilian infrastructure. Whatever Putin said in Alaska, his real actions reject diplomacy, dialogue, and peace efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1960945855780765705&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1960945855780765705&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a residential home in Kyiv ruined by Russia. People may still be under the rubble. This horrific sight proves that Putin will only stop when faced with pressure and strength. We urge public condemnation and action: new sanctions on Russia and strengthening for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1960945881366098006&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1960945881366098006&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak on “X”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything you need to know about the terrorist state, Putin, and their so-called “desire” for peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/AndriyYermak/status/1960894814313992619&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/AndriyYermak/status/1960894814313992619&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyiv city center. Ordinary residential buildings were damaged as a result of a Russian attack on the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/AndriyYermak/status/1960981276703236533&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/AndriyYermak/status/1960981276703236533&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kyiv, Russia has already killed 15 people, including 4 children. &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/AndriyYermak/status/1961014915176505695&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://x.com/AndriyYermak/status/1961014915176505695&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statement of the UCCRO on the latest Russian terrorist attacks against Ukrainian cities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the night of August 27–28, 2025, the Russian state once again launched terrorist attacks against the cities of Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, and other Ukrainian towns. As a result of missile and drone strikes, civilians — including children — were killed and wounded. Residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, including a kindergarten, were destroyed or damaged; hundreds of people lost their homes, and thousands of Ukrainians endured the terror of nighttime assaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dictatorial Russian regime has once again exposed its inhumane nature and its criminal, genocidal policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We strongly condemn the latest terrorist attacks carried out by the Russian Federation against Ukrainian cities and villages, which once again confirm its nature as a terrorist state. Any support now extended to the Russian Federation is, in fact, support for murderers and criminals, and carries with it undeniable moral responsibility. Money earned through business with Russia today is stained with the blood of innocent victims, and that blood cries out to Heaven for just retribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We extend our deepest condolences to the families of the victims and pray for all those who have suffered at the hands of Russian terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also take this opportunity to express our profound gratitude to all religious leaders, believers of different denominations, and people of goodwill for their unwavering support of the Ukrainian people, for their prayers for an end to Russian military aggression, and for their commitment to the establishment of a just and lasting peace for Ukraine and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vrciro.ua/en/statements/statement-by-the-ukrainian-council-of-churches-and-religious-organizations-on-the-latest-russian-terrorist-attacks-against-ukrainian-cities&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://vrciro.ua/en/statements/statement-by-the-ukrainian-council-of-churches-and-religious-organizations-on-the-latest-russian-terrorist-attacks-against-ukrainian-cities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNITED24 Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;«Russian forces deliberately targeted a residential building with a &quot;doube-tap&quot; strike during the latest attack, CCTV footage shows.

      <title>Why Labeling Muslim Brotherhood “Chapters” as Terrorist Groups Is Problematic</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/muslim-brotherhood-terrorist-designation-problematic</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;The White House this past November issued a Presidential action statement designating certain Muslim Brotherhood “chapters” as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/designation-of-certain-muslim-brotherhood-chapters-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations-and-specially-designated-global-terrorists/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; organizations. On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department and U.S. Treasury Department announced the designations of the Lebanese, Jordanian, and Egyptian chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organizations. The Egyptian and Jordanian chapters received a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) designation. The Lebanese chapter received both the SDGT designation and a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) designation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2019, Washington, responding to mounting pressure by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, decided to brand the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (MB) a terrorist organization. There was no mention of “chapters” outside Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having followed the MB and interviewed many of its members for years during my government service, I published an article in 2019 questioning the underlying assumptions of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lobelog.com/trumps-disastrous-plan-for-the-muslim-brotherhood/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt;. This article is a revised version of my 2019 piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I argued in the 2019 piece that the administration’s decision at the time did not reflect a deep knowledge of the origins of the Muslim Brotherhood and its connection to Muslim societies and political Islam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2025, the leaders of the United Arab Republic, Jordan, Bahrain, and Lebanon pressured the administration to label the MB a terrorist group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Second, under the influence of the pro-Western corrupt monarchy lead first by King Fuad and later by his son King Faruk, the MB’s founder believed that Muslim Egypt was drifting away from Islam. Egypt of course is the home of Al-Azhar University, the oldest Muslim academic center of learning in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Al-Azhar University represents the philosophical and theological thought of the three major Schools of Jurisprudence in Sunni Islam—the Hanafi, the Maliki, and the Shafi’i Schools. The fourth and smallest School of Jurisprudence—the Hanbali—is embodied in the Wahhabi-Salafi doctrine and is prevalent in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al-Banna’s two founding principles were: a) Islam is the solution to society’s ills (“&lt;em&gt;Islam hua al-Hal”&lt;/em&gt;), and b) Islam is a combination of Faith (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;), Society (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;unya&lt;/em&gt;) and State (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;awla&lt;/em&gt;). He believed, correctly for the most part, that these principles, especially the three Arabic &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;s, underpin all Sunni Muslim societies, other than perhaps the adherents of the Hanbali School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past 98 years, the Muslim Brotherhood has undergone different reiterations from eschewing politics to accepting the authority of Muslim rulers to declaring war against some of them to participating in the political process through elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain MB thinkers and leaders over the past nine decades, including the Egyptian Sayyid Qutb, the Syrian Muhammad Surur, and the Palestinian Abdullah Azzam, adopted a radical violent view of Islamic jihad and either allied themselves with some Wahhabi clerics in Saudi Arabia or joined al-Qa’ida. The organization itself generally stayed away from violent jihad. Consequently, it would make sense to label certain leaders or certain actions as terrorist but not the entire group or the different Islamic political parties in several countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

While Islamic Sunni parties in different countries adopted the basic theological organizing principles of the MB on the role of Islam in society, they were not “chapters” of the MB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are free standing Islamic political groups and movements, legally registered in their countries, which often focus on economic, health, and social issues of concern to their communities. They are not tied to the MB in command, control, or operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples of these Sunni Islamic political parties include the AKP in Turkey, the Islamic Action Front in Jordan, Justice and Development in Morocco, al-Nahda in Tunisia, the Islamic Constitutional Movement in Kuwait, the Islamic Movement (RA’AM) in Israel, PAS in Malaysia, PKS in Indonesia, the Islamic Party in Kenya, and the National Islamic Front in Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my government career, my analysts and I spent years in conversations with representatives of these parties with an eye toward helping them moderate their political positions and encouraging them to enter the mainstream political process through elections. In fact, most of them did just that. They won some elections and lost others, and in the process, they were able to recruit thousands of young members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these conversations, we concluded that these groups were pragmatic, mainstream, and committed to the dictum that electoral politics was a process, and not “one man, one vote, one time.” Because they believed in the efficacy and value of gradual peaceful political change, they were able to convince their fellow Muslims that a winning strategy at the polls was to focus on bread-and-butter issues, including health, education, and welfare, that were of concern to their own societies. They projected to their members a moderate vision of Islam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labeling the Muslim Brotherhood and other mainstream Sunni Islamic political parties as terrorist organizations could radicalize some of the youth in these parties and opt out of electoral politics. Some of the party leaders would become reticent to engage with American diplomats, intelligence officers, and other officials at U.S. embassies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington inadvertently would be sending a message to Muslim youth that the democratic process and peaceful participation in electoral politics are a sham, which could damage American national security and credibility in many Muslim countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>Uber Krysha: How Russia Turns Crime into Power—and Poison</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-crime-uber-krysha</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;Current discussion of Russian &quot;hybrid warfare&quot; tends to revolve around concepts like disinformation, proxy militias, cyber operations, sabotage, and psychological manipulation designed to fragment, confuse, and demoralize Russia's opponents—and the respective roles these play in Russian military and national security doctrine. Yet one essential dimension remains underdeveloped in the broader debate: the organic integration of criminal structures and methods into Russia's strategic toolkit. Russia's system does more than merely operate in a &quot;gray zone.&quot; It has become a gray state, sustained by an &quot;&lt;em&gt;Uber Krysha&lt;/em&gt;,&quot; a super-protection racket in which the Kremlin fuses its security apparatus with organized crime to project influence and intimidation both at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enabling mentality behind this fusion can be directly tied to Russia's pre-revolutionary period. Although no longer ideologically communist, Russia's current ruling elite, led by President Vladimir Putin, has very much inherited the Bolsheviks' comfort with adopting criminal methods in the pursuit of regime objectives. Before 1917, Lenin's Bolshevik Party &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.labrujulaverde.com/en/2024/04/when-lenin-and-stalin-robbed-the-bank-of-tiflis-in-1907/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;financed its operations partly through armed robberies&lt;/a&gt; justified as the expropriation of bourgeois wealth for the sake of the proletarian struggle. The Bolsheviks were revolutionary in ideology but gangster in practice, rationalizing robbery and violence not as moral lapses, but as necessary transgressions—crime rebranded as virtue in the service of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, during the early years of the USSR, the communist regime was defiantly, even boastfully, dismissive in its rejection of “bourgeois” legal norms. Its November 1918 decree &lt;em&gt;On Red Terror&lt;/em&gt; (yes, it was called that) is a good case in point. It formally authorized the secret police, the Cheka, to summarily arrest and execute perceived opponents of the revolution without trial, which it proceeded to do in the tens of thousands. In doing so, the new revolutionary state openly and unapologetically signaled to its people and to the world that it would not be bound by the ordinary moral limits of civilized life. Terror was not a regrettable excess, but a management tool. This was not moral confusion, it was moral disregard elevated to state policy, with a legacy that has left a deep imprint on the political DNA of contemporary Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the Soviet state engaged in its bloody ideological experiment, common criminality thrived in the workers' paradise. The inefficient Soviet economic system brought chronic scarcity, which, as it does everywhere, spawned smuggling and black-market behaviors. The state imposed tight controls, but the security services did not shy away from making expedient use of criminal gangs as instruments of control to help impose a brutal order among inmates in its sprawling GULAG camp system, or using petty thieves and prostitutes to report on dissidents and foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Soviet Union collapsed, however, these controls dissolved, and the roles suddenly reversed. In 1991 the Soviet security apparatus imploded, and many KGB and GRU officers migrated to the emerging oligarchic and criminal economy left in its wake. There they became security chiefs, &quot;political technologists,&quot; oil traders, and gangsters, using their skills and muscle to help these entities provide a &quot;krysha&quot; (roof)—similar in meaning to &quot;protection&quot; in Western mafia parlance—by combining inside connections, intelligence tradecraft, violence, and financial engineering. When Putin—himself a KGB veteran whose purview over foreign trade and city assets as St. Petersburg’s Deputy Mayor brought him into contact with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamestown.org/newsweek-details-putins-alleged-organized-crime-ties/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;port rackets, fuel schemes, and the Tambov crime syndicate&lt;/a&gt;—rose to the presidency in 1999, he re-asserted state primacy not by dismantling this nexus, but by mastering it. Putin's Kremlin in effect became the &lt;em&gt;Uber Krysha&lt;/em&gt;, the ultimate protection roof above the oligarchs, security chiefs, and crime bosses. The bargain was clear: enjoy your wealth and impunity, but serve the state—effectively Putin—when called. Loyalty was enforced not by law or shared purpose, but by leverage, fear, and mutual criminal exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

The unprecedented circulation of cadres that occurred during this period fostered a profound organizational and behavioral cross-pollination between intelligence, oligarchic, and criminal elements resulting in a qualitatively new and insidious mutation that is today’s Russia—Putin's Russia. The 1990s saw an &lt;a href=&quot;https://eurasiainstitutes.org/files/file/ceers_wp_post_soviet_organized_crime.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;outflow of KGB and GRU officers&lt;/a&gt; who &quot;pollenated&quot; the criminal/oligarchic economy with their tradecraft, tools, and government connections. Putin’s reconsolidation of state power in the 2000s then saw a return flow creating a &quot;reverse-pollination&quot; as ex-intelligence officers brought their new underworld relationships, financial channels, and expanded operational flexibility back to the security services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among contemporary scholars, the historian and journalist &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Mark-Galeotti-Gangsters-at-war-Russias-use-of-organized-crime-as-an-instrument-of-statecraft-GI-TOC-November-2024.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mark Galeotti stands out&lt;/a&gt; as the leading theorist and interpreter of this phenomenon, pointing out how modern Russia's power projection depends on cultivating deniability through criminal intermediaries. Galeotti's concept of the Kremlin as a &quot;political-criminal nexus&quot; and his description of its global &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecfr.eu/publication/crimintern_how_the_kremlin_uses_russias_criminal_networks_in_europe/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;crimintern&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/a&gt; offers a crucial corrective to more conventional security studies frameworks. Where others see diffusion of state control as a weakness, Galeotti sees design—a pragmatic outsourcing of coercion and corruption to actors who maintain loyalty through mutual dependence. In this arrangement, the lines between mafia, mercenaries, business, and ministries are blurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's asymmetric tactics abroad leveraging smuggling networks, compromising criminal entanglement (kompromat), cyber hacking, illicit financing, and global shadow operations by semi-private mercenary groups, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2025/03/24/russia-in-africa-private-military-proxies-in-the-sahel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wagner Group and the Africa Corps&lt;/a&gt;, extend this logic internationally. &lt;a href=&quot;https://newlinesinstitute.org/strategic-competition/how-russia-uses-organized-crime-for-espionage/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Liaisons between the Russian intelligence and crime groups across Europe&lt;/a&gt; also give Moscow access to local networks for espionage, intimidation, and assassinations that can act faster, at lower cost, and with more deniability than professional intelligence officers. But while most analysts tend to focus on this as a blending of tools—military, intelligence, cyber, informational— Galeotti’s insight is sharper: the blend itself is criminal in nature, structurally fusing coercion, corruption, and deceit into a governing logic—&lt;strong&gt;not as a breakdown of state power, but as its deliberate expression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Yet you will never find this asymmetric dimension acknowledged in Russian doctrinal writings despite its widespread exploitation in Russian actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policymakers in the Western democracies struggle mightily to wrap their minds around this phenomenon. Their siloed agencies—CIA for HUMINT, NSA for SIGINT/cyber, DOD for military, and FBI for crime, etc.—operate under strict legal separations between these domains to protect civil liberties. Effective in their respective arenas, they are vulnerable when adversaries operate across boundaries. Russia’s mafia-state collapses these distinctions and thrives in the weeds, exploiting moral disregard and legal ambiguity to create jurisdictional confusion and cognitive overload that stymie efforts at response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

Its reliance on criminal intermediaries corrodes institutional coherence. Loyalty is transactional, not ideological, and emptied of moral meaning. The fates of figures like Yevgeniy Prigozhin and various siloviki-linked oligarchs demonstrate how rapidly beneficiaries can become threats once their ambitions outgrow the tolerance of the Center. Moreover, by incentivizing enrichment over competence, criminal methods undermine professionalism within the military, intelligence services, government bureaucracy, and the private sector. Corruption pervades procurement, logistics, and governance, eroding capacity even as it funds loyalty. This was clearly evident in the shocking underperformance of Russia's military and intelligence operations in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internationally, what appears cunning in the short term produces isolation in the long term. Russia's growing reputation as a mafia state alienates legitimate partners, of which it now has few, and hollows out whatever moral legitimacy it once had. Putin's &lt;em&gt;Uber Krysha&lt;/em&gt; model is unsustainable in the long run because it requires continuous motion. It cannot stand on genuine law or trust, only perpetual leverage and fear, with tools that must be continuously re-coerced. The Russian people and others who are caught in its reach exist in an environment of moral blackmail that breeds cynicism rather than solidarity. Galeotti's moral edge, implicit in his scholarship, lies in showing that the criminal state is not merely a threat to others, it is a tragedy for Russia itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fully understand Russian asymmetric warfare today, we must appreciate its blending of the state and criminal domains and recognize that Moscow hasn't simply rewritten the rules of war for the gray zone, it has blurred the lines between law and criminality and has itself become a gray state. It is the malignant ethos of this new Russian &lt;em&gt;Uber Krysha&lt;/em&gt; state—the normalization of moral disregard—that, more than any cyber weapon or troll farm, has become its most dangerous export.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>Iran’s Crumbling Revolutionary Facade: How Today’s Protests Could Reshape the Region in 2026</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/iran-crumbling-revolutionary-facade-protests</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;I am&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;closely watching the growing size and momentum of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/irans-protests-expose-deeper-fragility-as-leaders-struggle-to-contain-crisis&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;protesters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; across Iran’s cities, rural areas, and pious communities who are bravely and vocally rejecting the Supreme Leader’s broken policies. They have shined a light on Khamenei’s gross mismanagement of the economy and the severe multi-year drought; his constant agitation and hostile relations with neighbors; Iran’s loss of prestige and influence with coreligionist communities in Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria; his failures against foreign attacks; and his misguided alliance with Russia against Ukraine. Even regime loyalists have begun murmuring such complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regime instability indicators and warnings are blinking. I believe Iran’s revolutionary facade is crumbling, but into an uncertain future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

If such cracks appear, new non-revolutionary leaders could emerge as quickly as al-Sharaa rose to power in Syria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters, however, most likely lack experience running cities, provinces, and the federal government. New non-revolutionary leaders therefore probably would look to the U.S. for assurance and support – and right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the protests produce a new Supreme Leader under a revolutionary Velāyat-e Faqih theocracy model, however, the future looks quite dark. Crackdowns would probably be quite harsh and swift, the nuclear program would most likely march on, and Tehran undoubtedly would keep funneling money and arms to trusted proxies that threaten the U.S. and Israel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

Nothing, in my view, would stabilize the region between the Black Sea, Eastern Mediterranean, and the Persian Gulf faster than a peaceful, non-nuclear and wealthy Iran that recognizes the state of Israel and distances itself from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most pendulums eventually swing, and I am watching for this one to swing in support of the Iranian people finally having a chance to rejoin a community of free nations that value peace, prosperity, and democracy. If non-revolutionary leaders were to emerge, the West could&lt;strong&gt; finally and quickly &lt;/strong&gt;work towards restoring a genuinely peaceful future that ends Tehran's nuclear weapons program; breaks its deadly alliance with Russia; terminates its costly support to Hizballah, Hamas, and the Houthis; and welcomes Iran into the community of nations as a responsible, wealth-producing global energy partner. May the pendulum swing decisively in these directions in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the US Government.

If Trump appoints a pliant successor, monetary policy will likely be looser than warranted, stoking inflation and undermining global economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump’s Power Doctrine: A $1.5 Trillion Military, Greenland Ambitions, and a World Ruled by Force</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/trump-power-doctrine-military-greenland</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;“After long and difficult negotiations with Senators, Congressmen, Secretaries, and other Political Representatives, I have determined that, for the Good of our Country, especially in these very troubled and dangerous times, our Military Budget for the year 2027 should not be $1 Trillion Dollars, but rather &lt;a href=&quot;https://defensescoop.com/2026/01/07/trump-calls-for-1-5-trillion-defense-budget-2027/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;$1.5 Trillion Dollars&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This will allow us to build the ‘Dream Military’ that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115855894695940909&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Truth Social&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; message from President Trump posted last Wednesday afternoon and illustrates the emphasis on increasing U.S. military power by him and top administration officials since the successful U.S. January 3, raid in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuelas-key-takeaways&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Venezuela&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that captured its former-President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it should, public attention has been focused on Trump’s apparent desire to project force as he publicly savors the plaudits arising from not only the Venezuela operation, but also the June 2025 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts-assess-strikes-response-and-what-comes-next&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Operation Midnight Hammer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bombing of three Iranian nuclear facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most focus this past week has been paid to remarks Trump made to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/11/us/politics/trump-interview-transcript.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reporters during their more than two hour interview last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that time, when asked if there are any limits on his global powers, Trump said, &quot;Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump added, “I don’t need international law. I’m not looking to hurt people.” Asked about whether his administration needed to abide by international law, Trump said, “I do,” but added, “it depends what your definition of international law is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention is also correctly being paid to remarks Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller made last Tuesday during an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/politics/video/senior-white-house-aide-stephen-miller-says-us-military-threat-to-maintain-control-of-venezuela-digvid&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else,” Miller told CNN’s Jake Tapper, “But we live in a world, in the real world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is against that Trump open-stress-on-power background that I will discuss below a few other incidents last week that could indicate future events. But first I want to explore Trump’s obsession with taking over Greenland, which was also illustrated during the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It’s never been more important to understand what’s happening in the world.

Today, there is only one American base – U.S. Pituffik Space Base in northwest Greenland, formerly known as Thule Air Base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this base today some 200 U.S. Air Force and Space Force personnel, plus many more contractors, carry out ballistic missile early warnings, missile defense, and space surveillance missions supported by what the Space Force described as an “Upgraded Early Warning Radar weapon system.” That system includes “a phased-array radar that detects and reports attack assessments of sea-launched and intercontinental ballistic missile threats in support of [a worldwide U.S.] strategic missile warning and missile defense [system],” according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.petersonschriever.spaceforce.mil/pituffik-sb-greenland/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Space Force press release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same radar also supports what Space Force said is “Space Domain Awareness by tracking and characterizing objects in orbit around the earth.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the 1951 U.S.-Denmark defense agreement, the U.S., with Denmark’s assent, can create new “defense areas” in Greenland “necessary for the development of the defense of Greenland and the rest of the North Atlantic Treaty area, and which the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark is unable to establish and operate singlehanded.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement says further: “the Government of the United States of America, without compensation to the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark, shall be entitled within such defense area and the air spaces and waters adjacent thereto to improve and generally to fit the area for military use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That apparently is not enough freedom for President Trump, still a real estate man. As he explained last week to the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reporters, “Ownership is very important, because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success. I think that ownership gives you a thing that you can’t do with, you’re talking about a lease or a treaty. Ownership gives you things and elements that you can’t get from just signing a document.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This long-held Trump view that he must have Greenland was explored back in 2021. After his first term as President, Trump was interviewed by Susan Glasser and Peter Baker for the book they were writing, and they asked Trump at that time why he wanted Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/weta/washingtonweek/video/2026/01/trumps-greenland-threats-and-imperialist-ambitions&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;explained&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “You take a look at a map. So I’m in real estate. I look at a [street] corner, I say, ‘I gotta get that store for the building that I’m building,’ et cetera. You know, it’s not that different. I love maps. And I always said, ‘Look at the size of this [Greenland], it’s massive, and that should be part of the United States.’ It’s not different from a real-estate deal. It’s just a little bit larger, to put it mildly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all Trump’s repeated threats to seize Greenland militarily, it’s doubtful that will happen. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to meet with Danish and Greenland counterparts this week, and afterwards the situation should become clearer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Context is another test for analyzing Trump statements, and that seems to be the case when looking at his call for a $1.5 trillion fiscal 2027 defense budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

According to one Washington firm, the Trump EO represented “one of the most aggressive federal interventions into corporate financial decisions in recent memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EO caused shares of defense stocks to fall. Lockheed Martin fell 4.8%, Northrop Grumman 5.5%, and General Dynamics 3.6% during that afternoon’s stock exchange trading in New York. After the stock market closed, Trump released his Truth Social message calling for the $1.5 trillion FY 2027 defense budget and the next day, January 8, defense stocks experienced a sharp rebound. Lockheed Martin rebounded with gains of around 7%; Northrop Grumman rose over 8%; and General Dynamics gained around 4%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has not spoken publicly about the $1.5 trillion for FY 2027, but in his first message, he said the added funds would come from tariffs. He wrote, “Because of tariffs and the tremendous income that they bring, amounts being generated, that would have been unthinkable in the past, we are able to easily hit the $1.5 trillion dollar number.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that were not enough, Trump added that the new funding would produce “an unparalleled military force, and having the ability to, at the same time, pay down debt, and likewise, pay a substantial dividend to moderate income patriots within our country!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can be believed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nonpartisan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crfb.org/blogs/15-trillion-military-budget-would-add-58-trillion-debt-over-decade&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CRFB) said the $500 billion annual increase in defense spending would be nearly twice as much as the expected yearly tariff revenue, and the spending increase would push the national debt $5.8 trillion higher over the next decade. CRFB added, “Given the $175 billion appropriated to the defense budget under the [2025] One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), there is little case for a near-term increase in military spending.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should point out that the FY 2026 $901 billion defense appropriations bill has yet to pass the Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more event from last week needing attention involves Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday January 6, 2026, as Delcy Rodriguez, former Vice President, was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president, General Javier Marcano Tabata. the military officer closest to Maduro as his head of the presidential honor guard and director of the DGCIM, the Venezuelan military counterintelligence agency, was arrested and jailed, according to &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;El Pais Caracas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcano Tabata was labeled a traitor and accused of facilitating the kidnapping of Maduro by providing the U.S. with exactly where Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores were sleeping, and identifying blind spots in the Cuban-Venezuelan security ring protecting them, according to &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;El Pais Caracas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the U.S. responsibility toward Marcano Tabata if the&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt; El Pais Caracas &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;facts are correct ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to end this column with another Trump statement last week that stuck in my mind because of its implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It came up last Friday after Trump, in the White House East Room, started welcoming more than 20 oil and gas executives invited to discuss the situation in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have many others that were not able to get in…If we had a ballroom, we'd have over a thousand people. Everybody wanted. I never knew your industry was that big. I never knew you had that many people in your industry. But, here we are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump then paused, got up and turned to look through the glass door behind him that showed the excavation for the new ballroom saying, “I got to look at this myself. Wow. What a view…Take a look, you can see a very big foundation that's moving. We're ahead of schedule in the ballroom and under budget. It's going to be I don't think there'll be anything like it in the world, actually. I think it will be the best.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then said the remark I want to highlight, “The ballroom will seat many and it'll also take care of the inauguration with bulletproof glass-drone proof ceilings and everything else unfortunately that today you need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who, other than Trump, would think that the next President of the United States would need to hold his inauguration indoors, inside the White House ballroom, with bullet-proof windows and a roof that protects from a drone attack?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>Now Comes the Hard Part in Venezuela</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-now-the-hard-part</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT PERSPECTIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;Now comes the hard part in Venezuela. Dictator Nicolas Maduro and his wife &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/after-maduro-us-test-venezuela&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;are gone&lt;/a&gt; but the regime is still in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/08/maduro-gone-regime-intact-behind-the-scenes&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;power&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Most Venezuelans, particularly in the diaspora, are pleased and relieved. Many are also apprehensive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has decided to compel the cooperation of Maduro’s Vice President, Delcy Rodriguez, now interim president. It is not at all assured that she will be a reliable partner. The U.S. decision to work with those still in control was logical even if disappointing to some in the democratic opposition which, after all, won the presidential election overwhelmingly in late July of 2024. The opposition’s base of support dwarfs that of the regime but the military, intelligence services and police are all still loyal to the regime - at least for the time being. The Trump administration believes the cooperation of these elements of the regime will be necessary for the Trump administration to implement its plans for the country without further U.S. police and military actions on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

Oil production in Venezuela has declined by two thirds since Hugo Chavez, Maduro’s predecessor, was elected in 1998. This unprecedented decline was due to incompetent management, undercapitalization and corruption. Had Chevron not opted to stay in the country under difficult circumstances, the production numbers would look even worse. Resurrecting the oil sector will take time, money and expertise. The return of the U.S. oil companies and the infusions of cash that will be required will only happen if an appropriate level of security can be established — and that will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/after-maduro-us-test-venezuela&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;require&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the cooperation of the Venezuelan armed forces and police. Many senior leaders in those sectors are believed to have been deeply complicit in both the abuses and corruption of a government the United Nations said was plausibly responsible for “crimes against humanity.” Two of the regime figures most widely believed to have been, along with Maduro himself, the architects of the Bolivarian regime’s repressive governance are still in power, Minister of the Interior Diosdado Cabello and Minister of Defense General Vladimir Portino Lopez. They will need to be watched and not permitted to undermine U.S. efforts to rehabilitate the oil sector and orchestrate a return to legitimate, popularly supported and democratic government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

First, more than 80 percent of Venezuelans now live below the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/venezuela-more-mere-numbers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;poverty&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; line. Their needs must be addressed . Even the shrinking number of Venezuelans who aligned with the regime are hoping to see their lives improve. Between 2013 and 2023, the country’s GDP contracted by around 70 percent, some believe it may have been as much as 75 percent. As most of Venezuela’s licit economy is essentially moribund and the U.S. will be controlling oil exports, the poor will naturally look to the United States for help. Heretofore, the regime employed food transfers to keep the populace in line. That role should move to the NGO community, the church or even elements of the democratic opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it will be important to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuelas-key-takeaways&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;secure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the cooperation of the opposition, notwithstanding the Trump administrations to work with Delcy Rodriguez and company as the opposition represents the majority of Venezuelans inside the country as well as out. It will also be necessary to pay the military and it is not at all clear that the regime elements still in place will have the money to do so once oil receipts are being handled by the United States. If the U.S. is to avoid the mistakes that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein, attending to the needs of the populace and paying the rank and file of the military should be priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration should also move as quickly as the security situation permits to reopen the U.S. embassy in Caracas. There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/09/politics/us-state-department-team-arrives-in-venezuela-for-first-time-since-maduros-capture&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reporting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; out of Colombia that the U.S. Charge in Bogota has already made a trip to Caracas to evaluate the situation. This is a good thing. There is no substitute for on-the-ground engagement and observation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By sidelining professional diplomats in favor of amateurs who supposedly bring fresh thinking to the world’s most intractable conflicts, US President Donald Trump is channeling a long American tradition of anti-intellectualism. Inevitably, the United States will be made poorer, weaker, and more manipulable by adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Maduro and Noriega: Assessing the Analogies</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/maduro-noriega-analogies</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asked if there were any restraints on his global powers, [President Trump] &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/08/us/trump-nyt-interview&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;answered&lt;/a&gt;: “Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I don’t need international law.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;Nicholas Maduro’s fate seems sealed: he will stand trial for numerous violations of federal criminal long-arm statutes and very likely spend decades as an inmate in the Federal Bureau of Prisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How this U.S. military operation that resulted in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/after-maduro-us-test-venezuela&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;apprehension&lt;/a&gt; is legally characterized has and will continue to be a topic of debate and controversy. Central to this debate have been two critically significant international law issues. First, was the operation conducted to apprehend him a violation of the Charter of the United Nations? Second, did that operation trigger applicability of the law of armed conflict?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/law-enforcement-rationale-invading-venezuela-050124147.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Trump administration has invoked&lt;/a&gt; the memory of General Manuel Noriega’s &lt;a href=&quot;file://Users/geoffreycorn/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Mail%20Downloads/1A15D3D7-C7AB-4C09-9E15-7032C20E9322/A%20similar%20action%20was%20taken%20in%201989%20against%20Manuel%20Noriega.%20He%20was%20arrested,%20indicted,%20convicted%20in%20a%20court%20of%20law,%20served%20in%20prison%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20in%20Panama.%20And%20the%20Panamanian%20people,%20the%20American%20people,%20are%20safer%20for%20it.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;apprehension following the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama&lt;/a&gt;, Operation Just Cause, in support of its assertion that the raid into Venezuela must be understood as nothing more than a law enforcement operation. But this reflects an invalid conflation between a law enforcement &lt;em&gt;objective &lt;/em&gt;with a law enforcement &lt;em&gt;operation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suggesting Operation Just Cause supports the assertion that this raid was anything other than an international armed conflict reflects a patently false analogy. Nonetheless, if - contrary to the President’s dismissal of international law quoted above – international law still means something for the United States - what happens in Panama and to General Noriega after his capture does have precedential value, so long as it is properly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parallels with the Noriega case?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maduro was taken into U.S. custody &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venzeula-leader-arrest-maduro-manuel-noriega/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;36 years to the day after&lt;/a&gt; General Manuel Noriega was taken into U.S. custody in Panama. Like Maduro, Noriega was the &lt;em&gt;de facto &lt;/em&gt;leader of his nation. Like Maduro, the U.S. did not consider him the legitimate leader of his country due to his actions that led to nullifying a resounding election defeat by an opposition candidate (in Panama’s case, Guillermo Endara).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Maduro, Noriega was under federal criminal indictment for narco-trafficking offenses. Like Maduro, that indictment had been pending several years. Like Maduro, Noriega was the commander of his nation’s military forces (in his case, the Panamanian Defense Forces, or PDF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Maduro, his apprehension was the outcome of a U.S. military attack. Like Maduro, once he was captured, he was immediately transferred to the custody of U.S. law enforcement personnel and transported to the United States for his first appearance as a criminal defendant. And now we know that Maduro, like Noriega, immediately demanded prisoner of war status and immediate repatriation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is therefore unsurprising that commentators – and government officials – immediately began to offer analogies between the two to help understand both the legal basis for the raid into Venezuela and how Maduro was captured will impact his criminal case. Like how the Panama Canal itself cut that country into two, it is almost as if these two categories of can be cut into valid and invalid categories. Lets start with the invalid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

While I shared the view of almost all experts who have condemned this theory of legality, it seemed to be the only plausible rationale the government might offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears I may have been wrong. While no official legal opinion is yet available, statements by the Secretary of State and other officials seem to point to a different rationale: that this was not an armed attack but was instead a law enforcement apprehension operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, as could be expected, Operation Just Cause – the military assault on Panama that led to General Noriega’s apprehension – is cited as precedent in support of this assertion. This effort to justify the raid is, in my view, even more implausible than the drug boat self-defense theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its core, it conflates a law enforcement &lt;em&gt;objective &lt;/em&gt;with a law enforcement &lt;em&gt;operation. &lt;/em&gt;Yes, it does appear that the objective of the raid was to apprehend an indicted fugitive. But the objective – or motive – for an operation does not dictate its legal characterization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, a military attack was launched to achieve that objective. Indeed, when General Cain took the podium in Mar a Lago to brief the world on the operation, he emphasized how U.S. ‘targeting’ complied with principles of the law of armed conflict. Targeting, diversionary attacks, and engagement of enemy personnel leading to substantial casualties are not aspects of a law enforcement &lt;em&gt;operation &lt;/em&gt;even if there is a law enforcement &lt;em&gt;objective.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor does the example of Panama support this effort at slight of hand. The United States never pretended that the invasion of Panama was anything other than an armed conflict. Nor was apprehension of General Noriega an asserted legal justification for the invasion. Instead, as noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-91-174fs.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; Government Accounting Office report,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 20px;&quot;&gt;The Department of State provided essentially three legal bases for the US. military action in Panama: the United States had exercised its legitimate right of self-defense as defined in the UN and CM charters, the United States had the right to protect and defend the Panama Canal under the Panama Canal Treaty, and U.S. actions were taken with the consent of the legitimate government of Panama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more complicated issue in Panama was the &lt;em&gt;nature &lt;/em&gt;of the armed conflict, with the U.S. asserting that it was ‘non-international’ as a result of the invitation from Guillermo Endara who the U.S. arranged to be sworn in as President on a U.S. base in Panama immediately prior to the attack. But while apprehending Noriega was almost certainly an operational objective for Just Cause, that in no way influenced the legal characterization of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assertion that a law enforcement objective provided the international legal justification for the invasion is, as noted above, contradicted by post-invasion analysis. It is also contradicted by the fact that the United States had ample opportunity to conduct a military operation to capture General Noriega during the nearly two years between the unsealing of his indictment and the invasion. This included the opportunity to provide modest military support to two coup attempts that would have certainly sealed his fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With approximately 15,000 U.S. forces stationed within a few miles of his Commandancia, and his other office located on Fort Amador – a base shared with U.S. forces – had arrest been the primary U.S. objective it would have almost certainly happened much sooner and without a full scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That invasion was justified to protect the approximate 30,000 U.S. nationals living in Panama. The interpretation of the international legal justification of self-defense to protect nationals from imminent deadly threats was consistent with longstanding U.S. practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally this would be effectuated by conducting a non-combatant evacuation operation. But evacuating such a substantial population of U.S. nationals was never a feasible option and assembling so many people in evacuation points – assuming they could get there safely – would have just facilitated PDF violence against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No analogous justification supported the raid into Venezuela. Criminal drug traffickers deserve non sympathy, and the harmful impact of illegal narcotics should not be diminished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But President Bush confronted incidents of violence against U.S. nationals that appeared to be escalating rapidly and deviated from the norm of relatively non-violent harassment that had been ongoing for almost two years (I was one of the victims of that harassment, spending a long boring day in a Panamanian jail cell for the offense of wearing my uniform on my drive from Panama City to work).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With PDF infantry barracks literally a golf fairway across from U.S. family housing, it was reasonable to conclude the PDF needed to be neutered. Yet even this asserted legal basis for the invasion was widely condemned as invalid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on YouTube?

But that objective was never asserted as the principal legal basis for the invasion. Nor did it need to be. Operation Just Cause, in my opinion (which concededly is influenced from my experience living in Panama for 3.5 years leading up to the invasion) a valid exercise of the inherent right of self-defense (also bolstered by the Canal Treaty right to defend the function of the Canal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor was the peripheral law enforcement &lt;em&gt;objective &lt;/em&gt;conflated with the nature of the &lt;em&gt;operation.&lt;/em&gt; Operation Just Cause, like the raid into Venezuela, was an armed conflict. And, like the capture of Maduro, that leads to a valid aspect of analogy: Maduro’s status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“However the government wishes to label it, what occurred in late 1989-early 1990 was clearly an &quot;armed conflict&quot; within the meaning of Article 2. Armed troops intervened in a conflict between two parties to the treaty.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sentence is drawn directly from the opinion by the Federal District Court in response to U.S. opposition to General Noriega’s claim of prisoner of war status. Like Noriega, at his initial appearance in federal court Maduro asserted his is a prisoner of war. And for good reason: the U.S. raid was an international armed conflict bringing into force the Third Geneva Convention, and Maduro by Venezuelan law was the military commander of their armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government’s position on this assertion has not been fully revealed (or perhaps even formulated). But the persistent emphasis that the raid was a law enforcement operation that was merely facilitated by military action seems to be pointing towards a rejection. As in the case of General Noriega, this is both invalid and unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existence of an armed conflict&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately following news of the raid, the Trump administration asserted it was not a military operation, but instead a law enforcement operation supported by military action. This was the central premise of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cl.usembassy.gov/remarks-at-a-un-security-council-briefing-on-venezuela/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; made at the Security Council by Mike Waltz, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Notably, Ambassador Waltz stated that, “As Secretary Rubio has said, there is no war against Venezuela or its people. We are not occupying a country. This was a law enforcement operation in furtherance of lawful indictments that have existed for decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This characterization appears to be intended to disavow any assertion the operation qualified as an armed conflict within the meaning of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/gci-1949/article-2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;common Article 2&lt;/a&gt; of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949. That article indicates that the Conventions (and by extension the law of armed conflict generally) comes into force whenever there is an armed conflict between High Contracting Parties – which today means between any two sovereign states as these treaties have been universally adopted. It is beyond dispute that this article was intended to ensure application of the law of armed conflict would be dictated by the &lt;em&gt;de facto &lt;/em&gt;existence of armed conflict, and not limited to &lt;em&gt;de jure &lt;/em&gt;situations of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pragmatic fact-based trigger for the law’s applicability was perhaps the most significant development of the law when the Conventions were revised between 1947 and 1949. It was intended to prevent states from disavowing applicability of the law through rhetorical ‘law-avoidance’ characterizations of such armed conflicts. While originally only impacting applicability of the four Conventions, this ‘law trigger’ evolved into a bedrock principle of international law: the law of armed conflict applies to any international armed conflict, meaning any dispute between states resulting in hostilities between armed forces, irrespective of how a state characterizes the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By any objective assessment, the hostilities that occurred between U.S. and Venezuelan armed forces earlier this week qualified as an international armed conflict. Unfortunately, the U.S. position appears to be conflating a law enforcement &lt;em&gt;objective &lt;/em&gt;with the assessment of armed conflict. And, ironically, this conflation appears to be premised on a prior armed conflict that doesn’t support the law enforcement &lt;em&gt;operation &lt;/em&gt;assertion, but actually contradicts it: the 1989 invasion of Panama, Operation Just Cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief applies expert-level context to national and global security stories. Grant yourself full-access to Cipher Brief expert insights, analysis and private briefings in the new year by &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;becoming a Subscriber+Member&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Judge Advocates have been taught for decades that the existence of an armed conflict is based on an objective assessment of facts; that the term was deliberately adopted to ensure the &lt;em&gt;de facto &lt;/em&gt;situation dictated applicability of the law of armed conflict and to prevent what might best be understood as ‘creative obligation avoidance’ by using characterizations that are inconsistent with objective facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when those objective facts indicate hostilities between the armed forces of two states, the armed conflict in international in nature, no matter how brief the engagement. This is all summarized in paragraph 3.4.2 of The Department of Defense Law of War Manual, which provides:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act-Based Test for Applying Jus in Bello Rules.&lt;/strong&gt; Jus in bello rules apply when parties are actually conducting hostilities, even if the war is not declared or if the state of war is not recognized by them. The de facto existence of an armed conflict is sufficient to trigger obligations for the conduct of hostilities. The United States has interpreted “armed conflict” in Common Article 2 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions to include “any situation in which there is hostile action between the armed forces of two parties, regardless of the duration, intensity or scope of the fighting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what the objective of the Venezuelan raid may have been, there is undeniable indication that the situation involved, “hostile action between” U.S. and Venezuelan armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an international armed conflict within the meaning of Common Article 2 of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 – the definitive test for assessing when the law of armed conflict comes into force. To paraphrase Judge Hoeveler, ‘[H]owever the government wishes to label it, what occurred in [Venezuela] was clearly an &quot;armed conflict&quot; within the meaning of Article 2. Armed troops intervened in a conflict between two parties to the treaty.’ Labels are not controlling, facts are. We can say the sun is the moon, but it doesn’t make it so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prisoner of war status&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, like General Noriega, Maduro seems to have a valid claim to prisoner of war status (Venezuelan law designated him as the military commander of their armed forces authorizing him to wear the rank of a five-star general). And like the court that presided over Noriega’s case, the court presiding over Maduro’s case qualifies as a ‘competent tribunal’ within the meaning of Article 5 of the Third Convention to make that determination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But will it really matter? The answer will be the same as it was for Noriega: not that much. Most notably, it will have no impact on the two most significant issues related to his apprehension: first, whether he is entitled to immediate repatriation because hostilities between the U.S. and Venezuela have apparently ended, and 2. Whether he is immune from prosecution for his pre-conflict alleged criminal misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article 118 of the Third Convention indicates that, “Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities.” However, this repatriation obligation is qualified. Article 85 specifically acknowledges that, “[P]risoners of war prosecuted under the laws of the Detaining Power for acts committed prior to capture . . .”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article 119 provides, “Prisoners of war against whom criminal proceedings for an indictable offence are pending may be detained until the end of such proceedings, and, if necessary, until the completion of the punishment. The same shall apply to prisoners of war already convicted for an indictable offence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that like General Noriega, extending prisoner of war status to Maduro will in no way impede the authority of the United States to prosecute him for his pre-conflict indicted offenses. Nor would it invalidate the jurisdiction of a federal civilian court, as Article 84 also provides that,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prisoner of war shall be tried only by a military court, unless the existing laws of the Detaining Power expressly permit the civil courts to try a member of the armed forces of the Detaining Power in respect of the particular offence alleged to have been committed by the prisoner of war.” As in General Noriega’s case, because U.S. service-members would be subject to federal civilian jurisdiction for the same offenses, Maduro is also subject to that jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would obviously be different if he were charged with offenses arising out of the brief hostilities the night of the raid, in which case his status would justify a claim of combatant immunity, a customary international law concept that protects privileged belligerents from being subjected to criminal prosecution by a detaining power for lawful conduct related to the armed conflict (and implicitly implemented by Article 87 of the Third Convention). But there is no such relationship between the indicted offenses and the hostilities that resulted in Maduro’s capture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prisoner of war status will require extending certain rights and privileges to Maduro during his trial and, assuming his is convicted, during his incarceration. Notice to a Protecting Power, ensuring certain procedural rights, access to the International Committee of the Red Cross during incarceration, access to care packages, access to communications, and perhaps most notably segregation from the general inmate population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he will end up in the same facility where the government incarcerated Noriega, something I saw first-hand when I visited him in 2004. A separate building in the federal prison outside Miami was converted as his private prison; his uniform – from an Army no longer in existence – hung on the wall; the logbook showed family and ICRC visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concluding thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government should learn a lesson from Noriega’s experience: concede the existence of an international armed conflict resulted in Maduro’s capture and no resist a claim of prisoner of war status. There is little reason to resist this seemingly obvious consequence of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persisting in the assertion that the conflation of a law enforcement objective with a law enforcement operation as a way of denying the obvious – that this was an international armed conflict – jeopardizes U.S. personnel who in the future might face the unfortunate reality of being captured in a raid like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is not hard to imagine how aggressively the U.S. would be insisting on prisoner of war status had any of the intrepid forces who executed this mission been captured by Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is just no credible reason why aversion to acknowledging this reality should increase the risk that some unfortunate day in the future it is one of our own who is subjected to a ‘perp walk’ as a criminal by a detaining power that is emboldened to deny the protection of the Third Convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>How China Built AI Dominance on Stolen American Silicon</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/china-ai-dominance-stolen</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/a-worker-is-operating-intelligent-equipment-in-a-workshop-to-produce-power-chip-packaging-and-testing-products-at-jiangsu-suxin.jpg?id=62639792&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C46%2C0%2C46&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP DIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;Federal prosecutors in Texas, in December, unsealed charges and related details exposing a sprawling scheme that quietly siphoned some of America’s most powerful artificial intelligence chips into China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to court filings, a Houston businessman and his company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/houston-businessman-and-company-plead-guilty-illegally-exporting-advanced-semiconductor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;orchestrated&lt;/a&gt; a $160 million smuggling operation that moved thousands of NVIDIA’s top-tier processors overseas, evading U.S. export controls through falsified shipping records and shell transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hao Global and its founder, Alan Hao Hsu, pleaded guilty on October 10, 2025, to participating in smuggling and unlawful export activities, including knowingly exporting and attempting to export at least $160 million in Nvidia H100 and H200 GPUs between October 2024 and May 2025. Investigators say the operation was funded by more than $50 million in wire transfers originating from China, and the U.S. has seized over $50 million in Nvidia hardware and cash as part of the broader investigation, with the seizures tied to the overall network, not solely this defendant’s operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operation reveals a broader strategy: if you can’t build it, take it. With a blend of state-run espionage and corporate infiltration, China has turned technology acquisition into an art form. Their ‘all-of-the-above’ approach has allowed their AI sector to grow even as export bans tighten. By sourcing the hardware from elsewhere, Beijing has made the lack of domestic chip manufacture moot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Corporate Insider Pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same month that prosecutors announced the NVIDIA chip smuggling charges, the Department of Justice filed a superseding indictment against Linwei Ding, a former Google software engineer accused of stealing over 1,000 confidential files containing trade secrets related to Google’s AI infrastructure. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/2024/05/01/former-google-software-engineer-charged-stealing-ai-trade-secrets-while&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;indictment&lt;/a&gt;, Ding uploaded the files to his personal cloud account between May 2022 and May 2023 while secretly working for two China-based technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is believed that the stolen materials included detailed specifications of Google’s Tensor Processing Unit chips and Graphics Processing Unit systems, as well as the software platform that orchestrates thousands of chips into supercomputers used to train cutting-edge AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ding allegedly circulated presentations to employees of his Chinese startup, citing national policies encouraging domestic AI development, and applied to a Shanghai-based talent program, stating that his company’s product “will help China to have computing power infrastructure capabilities that are on par with the international level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within weeks of beginning the theft, Ding was offered a chief technology officer position at Beijing Rongshu Lianzhi Technology with a monthly salary of approximately $14,800 plus bonuses and stock. He traveled to China to raise capital and was publicly announced as CTO. A year later, he founded his own AI startup, Zhisuan, focused on training large AI models. Ding never disclosed either affiliation to Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Google detected unauthorized uploads in December 2023, Ding vowed to save the files as evidence of his work. Nonetheless, he resigned a week later after booking a one-way ticket to Beijing. Security footage revealed that another employee had been scanning Ding’s access badge to give the appearance that he was working there during extended trips to China. Ding faces up to 175 years in prison on 14 counts: economic espionage and theft of trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ding has pleaded not guilty to the charges on multiple occasions. He entered a not guilty plea in March 2024 to the original four counts of trade secret theft, and again pleaded not guilty through his attorney, Grant Fondo, in September 2025 to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courthousenews.com/ex-google-employee-pleads-not-guilty-to-stealing-ai-secrets-for-chinese-companies/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.courthousenews.com/ex-google-employee-pleads-not-guilty-to-stealing-ai-secrets-for-chinese-companies/&quot;&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt; superseding charges — including seven counts each of economic espionage and trade secret theft. Fondo has actively represented Ding in court proceedings, including a successful June 2025 motion to suppress certain post-arrest statements due to alleged Miranda violations, though no extensive public explanatory statements from the attorney or Ding appear beyond these court actions and pleas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal trial in San Francisco began in early January 2026, with jury selection reported around January 8, and Ding remains presumed innocent until proven guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

Chinese state-sponsored hackers conducted the campaign, which Anthropic assessed with high confidence, targeted approximately 30 organizations, including technology firms, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers, and government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attackers manipulated Anthropic’s Claude Code tool into executing 80 to 90 percent of the operation autonomously. Claude’s safety guardrails were bypassed by jailbreaking the system, disguising malicious tasks as routine cybersecurity tests, and breaking attacks into small, seemingly innocent steps that conceal their broader objectives. Once compromised, the AI system independently conducted reconnaissance, identified valuable databases, wrote custom exploit code, harvested credentials, created backdoors, and exfiltrated data with minimal human supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The AI made thousands of requests per second—an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,” Anthropic stated in its analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This case is a huge concern for other companies that have almost fully adopted AI in their business operations,” JP Castellanos, Director of Threat Intelligence at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.binarydefense.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Binary&lt;/a&gt; Defense, tells &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;. “Instead of just using AI to draft phishing emails or assist human hackers, the perpetrators gave Claude direct instructions to carry out multi-stage operations on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/interpol-cybercrime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;implications&lt;/a&gt; extend far beyond technical sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An AI operator doesn’t have to sleep or take breaks moving at machine speed; the agent can do the work of dozens or more hackers, tirelessly and even without error, launching constant attacks that even human defenders would struggle to monitor, let alone counter,” Castellanos explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Geopolitical Officer at Insight Forward, Treston Wheat, also noted the operational tempo represents a fundamental shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI-enabled operations can run reconnaissance, exploitation attempts, credential harvesting, lateral movement playbooks, and exfiltration workflows in parallel, iterating rapidly across targets,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift not only changes how operations are conducted but also reveals the hidden supply chains that enable them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DeepSeek’s Smuggled Silicon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2025, it became impossible to ignore the connection between black-market chips and stolen IP. It was then that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/expert-qa-inside-chinas-deepseek-ai-miracle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DeepSeek&lt;/a&gt; dropped the R1 model, claiming it could compete with OpenAI’s o1, but for significantly less. This, however, immediately set off alarm bells: How does a company hamstrung by U.S. sanctions move that fast without some serious ‘outside’ help?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports from The Information in December 2025 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deepseek-is-using-nvidias-banned-blackwell-chips&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that DeepSeek is training its next-generation model using thousands of NVIDIA’s advanced Blackwell chips — processors specifically banned from export to China. The smuggling operation reportedly involves purchasing servers for phantom data centers in Southeast Asia, where Blackwell sales remain legal. After inspection and certification, smugglers allegedly dismantle entire data centers rack by rack, shipping GPU servers in suitcases across borders into mainland China, where the chips are reassembled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/nvidia-report-china-deepseek-ai-blackwell-chips.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;disputed&lt;/a&gt; the reports, stating it had seen “no substantiation or received tips of ‘phantom data centers’ constructed to deceive us and our OEM partners” while acknowledging the company pursues any tip it receives. The chipmaker is developing digital tracking features to verify chip locations, a tacit acknowledgement that there are enough smuggling concerns to warrant technological solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castellanos described China’s strategy as deliberately dual-track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“China has been very open to being the lead in AI and semiconductors and the need for self-reliance in core technologies,” he said. “But also, externally, China relies on partnering with overseas institutions, building on top of Western open-source technologies, and acquiring advanced technologies through illegal means, such as through theft, smuggling, and forced transfers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today.

In the realm of AI, this can include insiders siphoning source code, research papers, or semiconductor designs for China.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese approach exploits multiple vectors simultaneously, according to experts. The Ministry of State Security operates human intelligence networks. The People’s Liberation Army’s Strategic Support Force conducts offensive cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/us/chinas-lavish-funds-lured-us-scientists-what-did-it-get-in-return.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thousand Talents Plan&lt;/a&gt;, for example, then offers Chinese researchers financial incentives to transfer proprietary information to American institutions. By investing in and partnering with ostensibly private companies, state-owned enterprises gain access to sensitive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export Controls Lag Behind Reality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The export control regime designed to prevent China from accessing advanced chips has proven inadequate in the face of Beijing’s evasion tactics. The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security has repeatedly updated restrictions, most recently imposing sweeping &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/about-bis/newsroom/press-releases/3158-2023-10-17-bis-press-release-advanced-computing-and-semiconductor-manufacturing-controls-final&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;controls&lt;/a&gt; in October 2023 on AI chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent Texas case shed light on how these smugglers operate. There was more to it than simply shipping; they used crypto payments and paper-only shell companies to conceal the money trail. To pass customs, they even removed the Nvidia labels from the chips. By the time those processors reached China, they had been bounced through so many different countries that the original paper trail was basically gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Export controls are not a complete solution to IP theft or technology diffusion. They are best understood as a time-buying and friction-imposing tool,” Wheat observed. “If the objective is to prevent all leakage, that is unrealistic; if the objective is to slow adversary capability development, shape supply chains, and increase acquisition cost and risk, they can be effective when paired with enforcement and complementary measures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chip industry, analysts caution, is facing a structural nightmare. We’re restricting technology that’s already been stolen and studied. The $160 million operation out of Texas proved just how easy it is to game the system — they lied on customs forms hundreds of times over several months, and it still took nearly a year for authorities to notice anything was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defending at Machine Speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security experts are calling this the most significant tech transfer in history, and it isn’t happening by accident. By stacking insider theft, cyberattacks, recruitment programs, and smuggling on top of each other, China has found a way to leapfrog ahead in AI. They don’t have the domestic factories to build high-end chips yet, so they’ve bypassed the need for ‘original’ innovation by taking what they need. It’s a massive operation that’s making traditional defense strategies look obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The realistic U.S. approach is not to match China operator-for-operator. It is to win by asymmetry, such as scaling defense through automation, hardening the most valuable targets, and using public-private coordination to reduce attacker dwell time and increase attacker cost,” Wray said in his testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castellanos emphasized that defending against AI-enabled attacks requires matching the adversary’s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To have any hope to defend against this, we have to multiply effectiveness through automation and AI, so basically fight fire with fire,” he underscored. “Doing this requires significant investment, new skills, and perhaps most challenging, trust in autonomous defensive AI at a time when many organizations are still learning basic cyber hygiene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent adversaries from acquiring sensitive technologies, the U.S. Government has, in recent years, implemented targeted responses, such as the Disruptive Technology Strike Force in 2023. Yet, even as FBI investigations increase and new indictments are filed, the fundamental challenge persists. Chinese intelligence services use unlimited resources, legal compulsion over Chinese nationals, and long-term strategic patience to operate in an open society with porous institutional boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a challenge for policy makers; a multi-layered response and defense in depth is needed to protect the US AI technology base better,” Castellanos added. “Harden insider threat programs, accelerate public and private intelligence sharing, modernize export controls and enforcement, increase the costs or impose costs for the offenders of these attacks and lastly innovate faster to ensure even if China steals today’s tech, the breakthrough is already in the pipeline for tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>The 2026 Outlook Calls for Recalibration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The bullish AI narrative that dominated in 2025 is unlikely to continue overshadowing other lingering uncertainties, many of which reflect deeper structural shifts. Traditional factors underlying economic activity will be increasingly sidelined by national-security concerns, geopolitics, and domestic political machinations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Drawing on firsthand experience as a former Chief of Station and senior headquarters official overseeing the region, Fitzgerald offers a sobering assessment of Venezuela’s challenges, from rebuilding its institutions and oil sector to managing internal security threats while navigating the competing interests of China, Russia, Cuba, and Iran. The conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;expert-block-container expert-list&quot;&gt;

          A 37-yr. CIA veteran, David Fitgerald retired in 2021 as Chief of Station in a Middle Eastern country, which hosted CIA’s largest field station. As a seven-time Chief of Station, Fitzgerald served in numerous conflict zones to include Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and South Asia. He also held senior HQS positions that included Latin America Chief of Operations and Latin America Deputy Division Chief. He also served as the senior DCIA representative at U.S. Military’s Central Command from 2017-2020, where he participated in several tier 1 operations as the intelligence advisor to the commander.
    	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How are you looking at Venezuela at this moment through a national security lens? What do you see as the next real challenge the U.S. is likely to face there? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitzgerald: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;As President Trump has said, the U.S. intends to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/us-run-venezuela&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;run Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. I'm still waiting for how the U.S. government intends to define 'running Venezuela'. I'm going to assume, and I hate to assume, but I'll assume that the goal will be to work closely with the current Venezuelan government to transition to a democracy and allow elections, something like that. So that will just be my assumption in lieu of any comments or any guidelines coming out of the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You understand the history, the politics, the culture of Venezuela better than most Americans. Where do you think some of the bumps in the road will come as the U.S. tries to figure out and define, as you put it, what running Venezuela really means?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitzgerald: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;It's a very diverse country. It's an incredibly rich resource country. People talk about the oil and the petroleum, but it's not only that. It could be one of the largest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/venezuela-critical-minerals-target&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; producers in the world. It's amazing the amount of natural resources that Venezuela has, yet 25 years after President Chávez was elected as president, it's one of the poorest countries in Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think one of the hurdles that they're going to have is the brain drain. You don't have a strong cadre. A great example is Pedevesa, [Petróleos de Venezuela],&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the state run oil company. Back in the 90's, Pedevesa was considered one of the most efficient and best run oil companies in the world. Compared to even the private companies, it was a machine because they owned everything from downstream to upstream. They owned the drilling, they owned the pipelines, they owned the refineries, they owned the oil tankers, they owned the refineries in the U.S., they owned the distribution through their Citco company here. It was just an amazing company, and it was always held up as a model for state run companies. Of course, with the election of President Hugo Chávez, and then in 2002, the general strike when he just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/08/venezuela.oil&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; all of the Pedevesa members - even today, if you look around at the Chevrons, Exxons, the BPs, you'll find a large amount of former Pedevesa employees because they all migrated to the private petroleum companies because they were that good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, one of the biggest challenges is that Venezuela's going to need the financial means to really rebuild itself. I was last in Venezuela in 2013, and I'd been there in the early '90s, and it looked exactly the same. The infrastructure was terrible. Nothing had been modernized or built. So instead, what the Maduro and the Chavez government had done, was basically used Pedevesa as their cash cow to really distribute that money to themselves, steal the money, or distribute it to their followers. There was no effort to modernize the infrastructure or to do the necessary maintenance in the oil fields. That's why I think they're producing maybe 10% to 15% of the amount of oil they were at their peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for me, that's really the key. How do you get Pedevesa up and running so it becomes a profitable company again that can actually provide the necessary resources for the country to rebuild itself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

How difficult is that political component going to be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitzgerald: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;I think it's twofold. Not only the political component, but the security component. How do you transition from basically a dictatorship to some form of transparent democracy, which I think is the White House's goal. You do that via Delcy Rodríguez and the current Venezuelan government. As you know, the PSUV, which is the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, which is Maduro's party, they control every apparatus of government, whether it's the Supreme Court, the judicial branch, the legislative branch, the executive branch, it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/04/maduro-is-out-but-his-top-allies-still-hold-power-in-venezuela.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;owned&lt;/a&gt; by them. There is no transparency right now. How do you get away from that? How do you rebuild these institutions so they become functional again and in some type of democratic transparent manner? That has to be a principal goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number two, the security situation. You have maybe 20% to 25% of the population supporting Maduro and the PSUV. I would argue most of these people are supporting the party because they benefit from the party. They're either on the payrolls, they have some type of sweetheart deal, or they're able to conduct their illegal activities. The security forces are not hardcore ideologues. I think with the death of Chávez in 2013, he was the last ideologue you had as far as the Bolivarian revolution. My experience working with these people is that they're just in it for their own self-enrichment. Nobody really drank the Kool-Aid and said, &quot;I want to be a Bolivarian revolutionary.&quot; I mean, this might have happened during the earlier stages when Chávez was first elected, but through the decades, it's become just an empty suit. Nobody really believes in any type of revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the security side, getting back to that, you have a disruptive element. You have this organization called the Colectivos, which is kind of a non-official goon squad that is supported by the government, basically comprised of criminals and local bullies. During demonstrations, they're the ones who go out there and start beating people and stuff like that. But you have the security services themselves as well. The rank and file. I think if you can do something like we did maybe in the Haiti occupation and in Panama where we actually formed an interim security force — I can't talk about the Haitian National Police nowadays as an effective force — but at the time in 1994, they became an effective enough security force, which provided security to the populace. That led the whole population to believe that there was hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that's going to be key along with the political transition. Can you provide security? Can you provide faith that people will adhere to the rules and regulations? How you do that? It's a good question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela's a little different than most Latin countries. There is no national police force, other than the National Guard, which currently, if you talk to our DEA colleagues they'd probably say it's one of the largest drug cartels on the continent right now. Like the United States, Venezuela is divided into the state and municipal police forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Caracas has two major police forces. You have the city of Caracas Police Force, and then you have the Miranda State Police Force, which is about maybe a third of Caracas, and then the rest is by the city of Caracas. Then you go out to the different states in Venezuela. They each have their own police force, and the large cities all have their police force. Years ago, they tried to form this Bolivarian national police agency. We're trying to incorporate this. It's never really worked because these police forces are all influenced and run by the local politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, that could work to our advantage as far as being able to work independently of the government and work with these local institutions to not only enhance their capability, but kind of vet them, cleanse them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you think Russia and China are assessing what''s next in Venezuela? What are the losses here and what are the opportunities here for each of them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitzgerald: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Let's talk about China first because that's probably going to be the most important for Venezuela. China must be extremely careful about how they handle this because they have literally billions and billions of dollars in loans that they provided the Bolivarian government. And one of their concerns, no doubt is that if you have a new democratic government, they could come in and say, &quot;You know something? These loans that you signed with China, we don't consider them valid.  We think they're illegal, and we're going to nullify all the loans.&quot; And right now, China's getting paid back in petroleum. So, China's got to be worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that if you're China, you're going to make nice with any new government because you don't want to be in a situation where they just say, &quot;We consider these agreements you made with former government officials as illegal, and we will no longer honor them.&quot; So I don't see China being a spoiler. I see them willing to work with any new government coming into power because they have a lot of financial stake in what happens in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia, on the other hand, has very little commerce here. Russia's main trade with Venezuela is in arms. Venezuela's never even been able to pay back the loans or the purchases they made on some of the weapons systems they bought. Iran's another one. Iran's been there for decades now. It's entrenched. They've been allowed to work pretty much without limits in Venezuela, going back to, I think it was 2012, and the assassination attempt on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2011/10/12/141257930/u-s-foils-plot-to-kill-saudi-ambassador&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Saudi Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; in Washington. That was all being run out of, or being facilitated by, the Iranian embassy in Caracas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it's going to affect all of their relationships. Iran's been more important than they realize for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuelas-key-takeaways&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;oil industry&lt;/a&gt; as far as providing the parts and the 'know how' to maintain the oil fields and some of their refineries. A lot of that's coming from Iran. The big thing here that people don't realize is that there's one ingredient that's important for Venezuelan petroleum and if you don't have this, you really can't produce the amount of petroleum you need. Even at today's rate, you can't produce it. So Iran's been a major provider of this substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on YouTube? Insights so good, they should require a security clearance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How are drug cartels likely looking at this? And what about Cuba? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitzgerald: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I would love to be in Cuba right now and listen to what they're saying about this. I mean, this really must be a shocker for them. Number one, for their security service.  They just had a major failure because it's very well known that all of President Maduro's inner security was being provided by the Cubans. They're the only people he trusted. To a greater extent, they're out of security. Plus all their security services were being managed by the Cuban CI officers. The Cubans don't do it for free. So Venezuela pays the tab for that, and no doubt it's a greatly enhanced bill that they were getting from the Cuban government for President Maduro's security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other end, as you know, Suzanne, the petroleum is just as vital to the Cuban economy. It's not all of it, but it's a major percentage of the petroleum that Cuba uses to include refined products that are provided by Venezuela at incredibly reduced rates that Venezuela knows Cuba will never repay. So, they have billions of dollars in debts to Venezuela and although they're technically selling the petroleum to Cuba, there's pretty much an understanding that it's not going to be repaid. So that's going to be a big blow to Cuba right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the indicators that you're going to be watching for next that give you some clue as to where things might be headed?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitzgerald: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Well, my big indicator is what's the plan? I'm sure they're huddling together both in the IC and in the State Department and the White House trying to figure out, &lt;em&gt;'Okay, how can we transition the current government to some type of viable democratic government and allow for a free election?'&lt;/em&gt; And there's probably been a million plans thrown out there. They just haven't figured out which one they're going to use. So I think that's what I'm waiting for is what the administration intends to roll out as their plan and how they intend to run Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think one of the big things here as far as Venezuela goes, is how to actually rebuild the country. It's going to require the private sector. The U.S. government is not going to be some nation builder like we tried to do in Iraq. And the great thing is that Venezuela has the resources that are quite sought after in the world where I think you're going to get a lot of interest from the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a friend of mine asked the other day about the construction that would be needed. You're going to see some of the major construction companies needed to go in there and just rebuild the cities and the streets and everything. It's just the infrastructure there that hasn't been really modernized or updated in decades. So I think there is going to be a lot of interest in that. I think that interest by the private sector will also encourage the government to become as transparent and as democratic as it can be. So look for that too. And it's just not all about oil — it's minerals, construction, and the electric grid - it's across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is your place for expert-driven national security insights.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT PERSPECTIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to the inaugural edition of “The Iron Triangle”, my new &lt;em&gt;Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt; column that serves the three pillars of modern defense: Procurement Officers tasked with buying the future, Investors who fund the technology, and Policy Wonks who analyze the impact of technology on the global order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first column explores the shift from &quot;Chatbots&quot; to &quot;Agents.&quot; In Washington, they call it Agentic AI. In the Valley, they call it Action-Oriented LLMs. In the field, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/artificial-intelligence-modeling-earth-geoint&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the difference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between a system that tells you a storm is coming and one that autonomously moves your fleet to a safe harbor before the first raindrop falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Technology: From &quot;Prediction&quot; to &quot;Agency&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, AI in defense has been about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/leveraging-ai-in-no-fail-mission-for-u-s-intelligence&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Computer Vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tasks such as labeling tanks in a photo. While Computer Vision has saved countless hours of labor, it doesn't address the challenges associated with overloading analysts with data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agentic AI (Agentic) is a generational leap. For clarity, Agentic refers to systems capable of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analyzing the commander’s intent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identifying and evaluating subordinate tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Executing a sequence of actions across multiple platforms without human prompting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agentic processes vast amounts of data into knowledge, exponentially increasing each user’s effectiveness. With Agentic, teams of analysts will no longer pour through volumes of irrelevant information searching for a few key indicators. Agentic will distill torrents of data, a side effect of exponential increases in the number of sensors (drones), down to just the essential elements. In some cases, Agentic may even make decisions without user input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several questions come to mind. First, &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;what will my analysts do with this windfall of time?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That's a discussion for another article. Instead, let’s make this relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief applies expert-level context to national and global security stories. Grant yourself full-access to Cipher Brief expert insights, analysis and private briefings in the new year by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;becoming a Subscriber+Member&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Procurement Officer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Procurement officers should be wary of &quot;Black Box&quot; Contracts. If a vendor claims their agent uses &quot;proprietary reasoning&quot; that’s difficult to audit, walk away. Consider commanders whose primary concern is managing risk. In the inevitable post-accident investigation, &quot;the algorithm made a choice&quot; will not serve as strong legal defense. The Pentagon must demand Chain of Preference Transparency. The software must log why it chose one course of action over another, and the decision tree must be continually refined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon should also move away from Firm-Fixed-Price contracts. Agentic requires Continuous Authority to Operate, not only to remain functional, but in a competitive context (war with a global power). If The Pentagon buys a &quot;static&quot; version, the system will be obsolete by the time the invoice is cleared, especially considering the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/defense-acquisition-pentagon-steve-blank&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pentagon bureaucracy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Procurement Officers should buy the pipeline, not the package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Investment Thesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge for investors is distinguishing between a &quot;thin wrapper&quot; on AI and a foundational defense operating system. Investment firms often hire retired officers to evaluate defense technology. These officers retired years ago, and may not have had first-hand experience with technology while they were active. Now the investment firm expects them to provide advice on emerging technology that many 20-year-old practitioners are just learning about. It’s not a fair expectation, and will lead to investments in irrelevant technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proximity breeds opportunity. Investors should get involved with practitioners. I’m not suggesting that VCs attend National Training Center rotations, though I do enjoy that mental picture. There are other opportunities to interact with end users; small-scale exercises, trade shows and demonstrations are some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beware of the moat. The value isn't in the Large Language Model; it’s in the Action Layer. Investors should look for startups who are building &quot;high-side&quot; integrations—companies that have security credentials to plug into actual data. Only then will it become clear how the technology performs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for the exit. Some &quot;Big Primes&quot; are hardware-heavy and software-poor. They are looking to acquire &quot;Agentic Middleware&quot; to make legacy systems more relevant in an autonomous age. The &quot;Defense Unicorn&quot; of 2026 will be a company that provides the universal brain for antiquated hardware. There are some promising companies focused on exactly this challenge. Whatever is created should be collaborative, to promote and not stifle innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Policy Wonk’s Warning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days of AI, policy was concerned about AI’s potential effects on strategic stability. If both the U.S. and a peer competitor deploy Agentic to manage strategic command and control–or frontline skirmishes–we might enter a &quot;Speed of Relevance&quot; trap. When AI reacts to AI, the window for diplomatic de-escalation shrinks from hours to milliseconds, effectively disappearing and devolving into a machine on machine conflict where humans suffer the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent this devolution, there should be a foreign policy shift, a move from Arms Control to Algorithm Control. The next great treaty should not focus on the number of warheads, but the verification of &quot;Human-on-the-loop&quot; safeguards and universal standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

Military Officers, like everyone, suffer from functional fixedness. Their creativity can be limited by their experiences. Agentic will see thousands of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/rethinking-napoleonic-staff&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;potential pathways&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for conducting new missions. I like to think that this will lead to more creative solutions being applied to emerging challenges. Look out executive officers, AI is coming for your jobs!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a chance that our government becomes reliant on Agentic. The Military plans for everything. I’ve seen Staff Officers plan for how and when to make plans. Reducing planning &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-august-6/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;to a button click&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; could diminish critical analysis, a fundamental skill for effective leaders, which will have a compounding negative effect on future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission Rehearsals.&lt;/strong&gt; Agentic will enable warfighters to rehearse missions based on real time intelligence. Imagine flying a drone simulator where the terrain, the targets, and the weather are all precisely the same as those in the target area of interest. What’s more, Agentic will enable simulated adversaries to react more realistically. Combat Training Centers may be the next casualty of Agentic. I don’t think any soldier will be sad to learn that their NTC rotation is cancelled…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk.&lt;/strong&gt; Agentic might get it wrong, leading to gross overestimations–or underestimations–of adversarial capabilities. And what happens when a commander decides to ignore their AI, then suffers a defeat? Punishing the commander in this situation would encourage future leaders to blindly follow Agentic guidance. The government must build rules which preserve and promote &lt;a href=&quot;https://smallwarsjournal.com/2025/10/03/agentic-ai-decision-dominance/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;independent decision authority&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring that Agentic complements, but does not replace the commander’s judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agentic is the first technology that I can recall that doesn't just make our weapons better; it makes our decision-makers faster. For the Procurement Officer, it's a liability to manage; for the VC, it's the ultimate &quot;sticky&quot; SaaS play; and for the Wonk, it’s a terrifying new variable in the balance of power. Current international laws of war are based on human intent and accountability. But it remains legally unclear who is responsible—the developer, the operator, or the commander—when an autonomous agent makes an error. The most pressing requirement now is not for the best new technology, but for our legal and policy frameworks to keep pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joey Gagnard is a Cipher Brief columnist who regularly shares his perspective on national security and technology via his Iron Triangle column.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The killing of a 37-year-old Minneapolis mother by federal officials was certainly a tragedy and almost certainly a crime. But the administration’s response is something else: a demonstration that, in Donald Trump’s America, regurgitating obvious lies is how his followers and enablers prove that they belong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The protests now gripping Iran reflect, above all, economic grievances, which planned reforms are likely to exacerbate in the short term. Cash transfers and promises of lower inflation down the line are unlikely to be enough to appease a population battered by years of economic instability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although remittances from the African diaspora have grown steadily and consistently, their full potential remains untapped, because they usually fund immediate consumption rather than being pooled to drive systemic change. A new social model would make better use of the same funds, starting with health care.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Japan Can No Longer Afford Strategic Confusion</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/japan-postwar-strategy-no-longer-viable-by-taniguchi-tomohiko-2026-01</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Japan’s central challenge is often framed in terms of China’s rise, that is only part of the story. Japan’s postwar strategic framework has become obsolete, and this touches on everything from politics and economics to the country’s alliances and even constitutional matters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following the United States' illegal intervention in Venezuela, there is a palpable sense of uncertainty and foreboding, particularly among America's traditional allies. But it should already be obvious that things will not end well, either for the US or the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By dropping any pretense of defending democracy or human rights through its intervention in Venezuela, the Trump administration has ripped off the mask and shown the US-led global order to be untenable. To rebuild the idea of rules-based international relations, we will need a new philosophical foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With his attack on Venezuela, US President Donald Trump channeled the US leaders who sought to “liberate” Spain’s former colonies in 1898. But just as the Spanish-American War produced few real gains in the 20th century, Trump's efforts to revive the Monroe Doctrine in the 21st are more ambitious than realistic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Kremlin Files: Russia, the Modern Surveillance State</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-surveillance-state</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/a-view-of-the-general-office-of-the-fsb-kgb-building-on-january-23-2006-in-moscow-russia.jpg?id=62639578&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C8%2C0%2C9&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT OPINION / PERSPECTIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;Ask any Russian intelligence officer about “&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;naruzhka&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,” and you’ll see them nod knowingly. It’s the term for physical, trailing surveillance: watchers on the street who follow targets, track meetings, and report patterns. The Russians are experts at it, and they have been for centuries, dating back to the Tsarist Secret police, the Okhrana, and even further to Ivan the Terrible’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;oprichniki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the brutal enforcers of his regime. Surveillance is a subject that dominates Russian society and Russian espionage, and it also dictates how Russian intelligence officers (RIOs) conduct counter-surveillance and surveillance detection. The Russian intelligence services (RIS) still lean heavily on surveillance as both a protective and offensive tool. Given such an all-compassing presence in Russian society, the term &quot;surveillance&quot; and its connotations in Russia are worth exploring to better understand Russia, its state, society, and our adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russians have a saying, “the walls have ears,” and sometimes follow it with “and the streets have eyes.” Studying in Russia in the early 1990s as an exchange student, I was repeatedly warned by my friends with this expression. It was their way of telling our group of American students that no matter how welcome we felt— and Russians have some of the best hospitality in the world when you are welcomed by them— the state was still suspicious. We came to understand very quickly that there were minders among us: Russian students and professors who reported on us back to the FSB, the successor of the KGB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of our group of students were even “soft-pitched.” For example, in one case, a fellow student with a military background was asked whether he would like to meet with the FSB to discuss how interesting the Russian internal security service was (not exactly a soft approach, really). These blunt and clumsy attempts went unanswered, but the point was clear: the state was not just watching; they were operationally targeting our group of future soldiers, researchers, academics, and in at least one case, a future CIA officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

But the bar of intimidation has risen dramatically in recent years. With dissidents, journalists, and even athletes targeted for intimidation, beatings, arrest, and even murder, there is no safe haven in Russia any longer for foreign citizens. They are used as targets to be entrapped for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/world/who-are-detainees-russia-us-prisoner-swap-intl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;hostage exchanges&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the West. The goal is to swap civilians for RIOs for the latter to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russias-intelligence-services-after-the-war-will-they-be-held-accountable-for-their-failures&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;escape their failings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when arrested and convicted abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russians live in a state of constant fear, especially with the war in Ukraine, since opposition to the war, in any form, is now threatened by jail time. Anyone who may be a threat to the regime is subjected to overwhelming surveillance of their person, electronic communications, and contacts. The FSB has many resources at its disposal, including access to all ISPs and phone companies by law. In the early 2000s, the Russian Duma quietly passed laws giving the FSB access to all communication companies in Russia without the need for any warrants. It was the first step in creating their modern surveillance state and an early sign under Putin that democracy was dying.&lt;br /&gt;Inside Russia, surveillance teams from the FSB number in the many thousands. Their origins lie in the old KGB 7th directorate. Still, their mission remains the same: monitor diplomats, suspected foreign intelligence officers, journalists, NGO workers, businesspeople, and ordinary Russians who cross the regime’s lines. The teams are, unfortunately, among the very best in the world at surveillance, given their long history of practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveillance schools in Leningrad (St. Petersburg), in particular, were known as the best in the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Young surveillance team members from the KGB, GRU, and other services of the Soviet Union were trained in the art of on-foot and vehicle surveillance, effective radio communications, and spotting intelligence tells of possible espionage operations. Today, it is no different. The FSB, in particular, devotes considerable resources to surveillance work in Moscow and across Russia in every major city of its vast surveillance apparatus. They are increasingly assisted by technology and a vast array of cameras across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Russia, all universities, think tanks, and defense contractors, have assigned security officers, what the Russians call an “OB,” who monitor the foreign contacts, make Russians report on their foreign friends, and even many of their Russian ones. The OB is usually an FSB officer, but if not, they are a cooptee of the service, reporting directly to a UFSB or a regional office across Russia. The OBs, in turn, enlist networks of agent-reporters who are only too eager to report on the travel, potential misdeeds, disloyalty to the regime, or other offenses of all those they monitor. Russia today has a network of informers to rival Stasi East Germany, Nazi Germany under the Gestapo, or any other despotic regime, including North Korea and China of today (both of whom, admittedly, may also contend for the gold and silver on despotic modern surveillance states, together with Russia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The all-encompassing nature of the Russian surveillance state, which includes monitoring by city cameras (supplemented by drones now too), communications, and in-person surveillance, makes it clear that RIS surveillance is not confined to diplomats or foreigners suspected of intelligence affiliation. Academics, journalists, and corporate leaders can find themselves under observation or pressure when Moscow sees strategic value in them. Awareness of surveillance indicators—and how to respond—remains essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, for decades, Westerners traveling to Russia as academics, athletes, NGO workers, and others have been naïve on this score. The refrain is frequently that “I am no one of interest, they’ll leave me alone.” The RIS never did and never will. The pressure for the Russian services, in particular the FSB, to prove worthy of their giant bureaucracy and corrupt budget means they will manufacture spy cases when they can’t find real ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They map the routines of foreign officials, political or business leaders. Their goal is to decide if those targets are viable recruits, potentially, or targets for other operations, like extortion, “direct action,” or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-intelligence-kill-murder-putin&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;assassination attempts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Russia and abroad. This leads to another underappreciated aspect of Russian intelligence and espionage that permeates their society: setups, tricks, and double-agent operations, which the Russians call “operational games.” (That will be the topic of a future “Kremlin Files” column in &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Russian surveillance, the warning remains clear, and the potential risks are stark. Unfortunately, for all the beauty to be found in Russian history, its cultural sites and heritage, and with their people, traveling to the Russian surveillance state under this corrupt and authoritarian regime holds incredible risk for foreigners, and even for Russian citizens themselves. It will not change until the RIS no longer has the dominant role in society. Laws and checks on power don’t exist in the Russian services. Surveillance, in fact, guides the functioning of the Russian state, and the streets continue to have eyes- everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the US Government.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The question of which bets on &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;’s 2025 Person of the Year should pay out ignited furor on Kalshi and Polymarket, two major prediction markets.

      <title>Iran’s Supreme Leader Should Listen to the People</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/iran-listen-to-the-people</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT OPINION —&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The Iranian people are saying they want new leadership. And it’s not too hard to understand why so many merchants, university students and young people in Iran are on the streets calling for political &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/irans-protests-expose-deeper-fragility-as-leaders-struggle-to-contain-crisis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;change&lt;/a&gt; and an end to the current Islamic Republic rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the merchants in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/iran-security-forces-clash-with-protesters-at-grand-bazaar-at-least-36-killed-in-demonstrations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tehran’s Grand Bazar&lt;/a&gt; that initially closed their shops because they couldn’t make a living with soaring inflation and the collapse of the national currency, the rial. Merchants in over 32 cities quickly followed suit, with university students and the public joining in protests calling for change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not new for Iran. In 2009, the government ensured that incumbent Mahmood Ahmadinejad was reelected president, despite the popular opposition leader, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, having widespread support from the public, promising hope and change. The government’s heavy hand in ensuring their man was reelected, regardless of what the public wanted and voted for, understandably angered the public, resulting in Iran’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/13/iran-mahmoud-ahmadinejad-riots-tehran-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Green Movement&lt;/a&gt;.” Protesters, who adopted green as the symbol of hope and change, claimed the election was rigged. When they demanded greater democracy, the rule of law, and an end to authoritarian practices, the government responded violently. Peaceful protesters were beaten, with thousands arrested and dozens killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2022, Jina Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian was arrested for improperly wearing her head scarf (hijab). She died in police custody, with eyewitnesses saying she was beaten and died because of police brutality. The death of Amini resulted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/tehrans-protest-problem-may-run-deeper-than-it-thinks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nationwide protests&lt;/a&gt;, with Iran Human Rights reporting that at least 476 people were killed by security forces. Amnesty International reported that the Iranian police and security forces fired into groups with live ammunition and killed protesters by beating them with batons. Amini’s death gave rise to the global movement of: Women, Life, Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Iran has conducted a war against its own people, with widespread arrests of anyone protesting widespread government corruption and human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

This was after the people were told that Israel would never dare to attack Iran. But they did, with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hundreds of millions of dollars spent on Iran’s nuclear program, building thousands of spinning sophisticated centrifuges, enriching uranium at 60% purity, concealed in deeply buried underground facilities -- and related scientific work— certainly contributed to Iran’s economic collapse. The resultant global &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/defiance-meets-desperation-as-iran-faces-fresh-un-sanctions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sanctions&lt;/a&gt; imposed on Iran also contributed to the crumbling of Iran’s economy. Indeed, Iran’s long history of pursuing nuclear weapons and then claiming they ceased such a pursuit, although continuing to enrich uranium while denying IAEA access to suspect nuclear facilities ensured that the global community viewed Iran with deep suspicion and was supportive of the biting sanctions imposed on Iran. Iran’s nuclear pursuits and the resultant sanctions led to Iran’s failed economy. And it was the people who suffered when the rial lost its value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian acknowledged the legitimacy of the protesters’ complaints, while announcing the appointment of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/iran-currency-inflation-central-bank-governor-protests-ccc43409cfceed3096db8cf63cc0ce53&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new central bank chief&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reportedly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp37w9xnxxwo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;36 people&lt;/a&gt; have been killed during the demonstrations, with hundreds arrested and thousands on the street saying they want change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamnei, in an address on Saturday, blamed foreign interference and said that “rioters must be put in their place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump had warned Iran that if Iran “violently kills peaceful protesters” the U.S. “will come to their rescue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these and previous demonstrations tell us is that the people have suffered enough. They’ve taken to the street because they want change, hope and a leadership that cares for the people. The protesters carry signs saying, “the mullahs must leave Iran.” It’s clear: the government has mismanaged Iran’s economy; has made Iran a pariah nation. The Iranian theocracy, led by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, apparently no longer has the support of the Iranian people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is a democratic secular Iran possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The author is a former associate director of national intelligence.

      <title>Overcapacity Is China’s Biggest AI Advantage</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The global AI race will be won not by the power of models and chips, but by how effectively systems can be deployed and improved across the economy. China’s chronic excess capacity, long seen as its greatest weakness, has reduced costs and accelerated adoption, providing the country's AI sector with a decisive edge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Across much of the world, fertility rates are falling and populations are aging faster than economies can adapt, putting pressure on labor markets, pension systems, and public finances. The challenge is made more difficult to address by growing resistance from older voters and risk-averse leaders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The logic behind China’s family-planning policies was always suspect, as were the data that convinced officials to keep them in place long after it should have been clear that they had failed. The history of the 35-year one-child policy highlights a fatal flaw in Chinese governance, for which the country is paying a steep price.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The U.S. Says it Will “Run” Venezuela. What Will That Mean?</title>

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/pro-government-supporters-attend-a-rally-a-day-after-the-capture-of-nicolas-maduro-by-us-forces-on-january-4-2026-in-caracas-v.jpg?id=62668354&amp;amp;width=1200&amp;amp;height=600&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP DIVE – &lt;/strong&gt;As audacious and complex as it was for the U.S. to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-maduro-2026&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;extract Nicolas Maduro from Venezuela&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – and to do so without a single U.S. casualty – the challenges ahead may be even harder. “We’re gonna run it,” President Donald Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/loud-noises-heard-venezuela-capital-southern-area-without-electricity-2026-01-03/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Saturday, referring to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-was-a-surprise-what-could-be-next&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;post-Maduro Venezuela&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The president gave few details and no specific time frame, saying only that the U.S. would “run the country” until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could be arranged. U.S. oil companies would return to Venezuela, investing “billions and billions” of dollars to reboot the oil sector and the country’s economy. American “boots on the ground” might be deployed in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a remarkable series of statements from a president who has criticized past American nation-building projects, and it raised questions about how exactly the Trump Administration would “run” a country beset by profound challenges. Venezuela, a country twice the size of Iraq, has endured decades of authoritarian rule, corruption, drug-related violence, and economic pain. And for the moment at least, the country’s leader still pledges allegiance to Maduro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miguel Tinker Salas, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Venezuelan&lt;/a&gt; historian, Professor Emeritus at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomona_College&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pomona College&lt;/a&gt; and Fellow at the Quincy Institute, said that when Trump spoke those words – “we’re gonna run it” – he was stunned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Initially, my jaw dropped,” Salas told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Even at the height of U.S. influence in Venezuela, in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, they never said they wanted to run the country. And I don't think the Trump administration comprehends the complexity that they're dealing with for a country as diverse and as big as Venezuela.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even those who cheered the U.S. military operation warned of the difficulties that lie ahead. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who pronounced himself “delighted” by Maduro’s ouster, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e7HABk-Ji0&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; NewsNation the mission was “maybe step one of a much longer process. Maduro is gone but the regime is still in place.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maduro’s fall is good for Venezuela and the United States,” Richard Fontaine, CEO of the Center for a New American Security, &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RHFontaine/status/2007514907143467380&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;posted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on X. “It was a brilliant military operation and the world should be better off because of it. Whether it WILL in fact be better off depends on what happens next. One of the lessons of other regime-change operations is not to topple a government without a plan for what comes next. What comes next in Venezuela seems as vague as the plan for running postwar Gaza under a ‘Board of Peace’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Venezuelans who might lead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a news conference following Maduro’s capture, Trump said that Delcy Rodriguez, the regime’s vice president, would lead Venezuela as long as she “does what we want.” And he suggested the U.S. would enforce that arrangement at the barrel of a gun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/loud-noises-heard-venezuela-capital-southern-area-without-electricity-2026-01-03/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; adding that the U.S. might deploy “a second wave” of forces if Venezuelan officials or troops don’t go along with Washington’s wishes. The U.S. naval presence near Venezuela remains in place – the largest such deployment in the region since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;painted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a slightly different picture of the U.S. role. “It’s not running — it’s running policy, the policy with regards to this,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Rubio and Trump were clear about the overall approach: in essence, &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do what we say, and things will be fine. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to make decisions based on their actions and their deeds in the days and weeks to come,” Rubio&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “We think they’re going to have some unique and historic opportunities to do a great service for the country, and we hope that they’ll accept that opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear that Rodriguez, the former Vice President, will be a pliant ally. She was sworn in Monday as interim president, after almost immediately accusing the U.S. of invading her country on Saturday. She &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/world/americas/delcy-rodriguez-maduro-only-president.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;called&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the operation “a barbarity,” and in an address to the nation said that Maduro was still Venezuela’s head of state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicolás Maduro Moros,” Rodriguez &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/world/americas/delcy-rodriguez-maduro-only-president.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with other senior officials at her side. Venezuela, she said, would never agree to being a U.S. &quot;colony.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day later she &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-acting-president-seeks-us-govt-collaboration-2026-01-05/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;struck&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a less defiant note, calling on the U.S. to work with her government on an “agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development.” She added that “we prioritize moving towards balanced and respectful international relations between the United States and Venezuela.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not at all clear that’s what Trump has in mind; he insisted that Rodriguez would comply with his wishes – one way or another. &quot;She had a long conversation with Marco [Rubio], and she said, 'We'll do whatever you need,'” Trump said. “I think she was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice.” On Sunday he upped the ante, &lt;a href=&quot;http://v&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;telling&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that if Rodriguez “doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said Rodriguez will have to navigate an almost impossible political tightrope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She claims to represent a socialist party opposed to U.S. intervention and to U.S. meddling in her internal affairs – so how does she rationalize this to her base?” Salas said. “This is a very difficult, challenging position for her to be in – to on the one hand promise social change reforms, a continuation of Maduro, and at the same time, now become compliant in providing oil to the United States.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

They have denounced Maduro’s abduction as well – Padrino &lt;a href=&quot;https://mazo4f.com/en/padrino-lopez-the-countrys-military-forces-are-united-and-cohesive-in-the-face-of-imperial-aggression&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;vowed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to resist “the most criminal military aggression” and ordered a mobilization of Venezuelan forces on land, sea, and air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have warned of splits within the army – between hardliners who may refuse to support anyone who bows to Trump’s demands, and others who will stand with Rodriguez no matter what. Such divides could lead to violence and – if Trump is true to his word – a deployment of U.S. “boots on the ground.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Shifter, a former president of the Inter-American Dialogue, said that while Rodriguez might be able to deliver on Trump’s demands to open up the oil sector, other critical tasks will prove more challenging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It will be exceedingly difficult if not impossible for her to tame the entrenched corruption and widespread criminality in the country while leaving the machinery of Chavista governance intact,” Shifter told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, using a term for policies begun by Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez. “The risks that chaos, violence and instability will ensue are high, and under that scenario the U.S. would have no choice but to send in troops to stabilize the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Control of the military is essential for control of Venezuela, particularly in this unstable moment,” Salas said. “And so far, the commanding general of the military, Padrino, has shown no disposition to break with the PSUV [Maduro’s party].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent in the Trump plans for now is any role for the Venezuelan opposition. The main opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last month, issued a statement urging that her political ally, Edmundo Gonzalez, be recognized as Venezuela’s president. Gonzalez was widely seen as the rightful winner of the 2024 presidential vote. “Today we are prepared to enforce our mandate and take power,” Machado &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/world/americas/trump-venezuela-leader-rodriguez-machado.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in his news conference after Maduro’s capture, Trump never mentioned Gonzalez, and threw cold water on the prospects of a role for Machado. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think it'd be very tough for her to be the leader,&quot; Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;She doesn't have the support or the respect within the country. She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those remarks left Machado in the odd position of having won her goal of Maduro’s exit, while failing to win the backing of Washington. Salas said Venezuelans he had spoken with “were disillusioned about the fact that Trump essentially threw her under the bus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked Saturday which American officials would “run” Venezuela, Trump nodded to Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who flanked the president during his news conference. “The people that are standing right behind me, we’re going to be running it,” Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That drew a rebuke from Elliott Abrams, a Senior Fellow for the Council on Foreign Relations and longtime hawk in terms of U.S. policy in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Venezuelans wanted Maduro out and voted against him,” Abrams &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.cfr.org/click/43359392.4336/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2ZyLm9yZy9leHBlcnQtYnJpZWYvYXNzZXNzaW5nLXZlbmV6dWVsYXMtZnV0dXJlLWFmdGVyLW5pY29sYXMtbWFkdXJvcy1ib2xkLWNhcHR1cmU_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1kYWlseWJyaWVmJnV0bV9jb250ZW50PTIwMjYwMTA1/5deac970fc942d4a17cc4f78Bd4ae29de&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the organization’s website. “They did not vote for U.S. rule, and pursuing that path will create instability—exactly what Trump does not want.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The oil factor &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the months-long runup to Maduro’s capture, as the U.S. deployed naval forces to the Caribbean and attacked alleged drug traffickers from the air, the Trump administration justified its actions by invoking the drug trade and the illegitimacy of Maduro’s rule. Oil was rarely mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as U.S. officials explain their post-Maduro plans, oil is front and center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, Trump accused Venezuela of seizing U.S. oil assets in the country, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; U.S. companies would return to operate Venezuela’s state-controlled oil reserves, “spend billions of dollars” and “start making money for the country.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. oil companies have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/venezuela-crisis&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;long history&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Venezuela, dating to the early 20th century, when they came at the government’s invitation to explore and develop oil reserves. Gulf, Shell, and Standard Oil were among the early arrivals, in what proved to be a symbiotic relationship: the companies earned billions of dollars, and Venezuela grew rich; by the mid-1970s, oil revenues had helped make it the wealthiest nation, per capita, in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1976, Venezuela nationalized its oil industry, creating a state-owned company, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), that continued to partner with foreign companies. More than two decades later, President Hugo Chavez &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/business/chavez-drives-exxon-and-conocophillips-from-venezuela-idUSN26378950/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;renegotiated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contracts with foreign oil companies to boost Venezuela’s share of the profits, a move that prompted ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips to leave the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Venezuela’s oil sector and its broader economy suffered the consequences – a deteriorating oil infrastructure, and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and the PDVSA. Today, Venezuela &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Venezuelan_oil_industry&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;produces&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fewer than one million barrels of oil a day, down from roughly 3.5 million in 1997, and more than &lt;a href=&quot;http://v&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;90 percent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Venezuelans live in poverty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Venezuela has been a problem both for the United States and for the Venezuelan people for over 20 years,” Paul Kolbe, a former Director of The Intelligence Project at Harvard University’s Belfer Center, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “For the Chavez years and then the Maduro years, they've driven a country that was once one of the wealthiest in the world, and certainly the wealthiest in South America…into the ground through corruption, poor leadership, poor decisions, and oppression of the people.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one U.S. oil company – Chevron – has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/world/americas/trump-venezuela-chevron-oil.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;remained&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Venezuela, operating under joint ventures with the PDVSA. Rubio’s and Trump’s remarks suggest that the U.S. intends to force Rodriguez, the interim leader, to offer favorable conditions to other American companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts aren’t sure the others will return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali Moshiri, who oversaw Chevron’s operations in Venezuela until 2017, said the big oil firms won’t go back until they clear signs of change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not many companies are going to rush to go into an environment where there’s not stability,” Moshiri &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/05/business/energy-environment/venezuela-oil-us-chevron.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;He also said that while Chevron and smaller operators could boost the country’s oil output slightly in the short term, a more robust expansion would take years, given the political situation, the state of the country’s oil infrastructure, and the time needed to reestablish operations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salas echoed the point. “Exporting oil from Venezuela is a challenge,” he told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; “The infrastructure has collapsed. The oil itself that has to be pumped out of the ground is heavy crude, which requires a lot of technology, and billions of dollars of investment. So I'm not convinced that American companies are going to be running in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; on YouTube?

The list of other cases is long – and while each episode had its own specific history, there have been few good outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To take three very different examples: The 2003 decapitation of the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq – which involved a huge force of “boots on the ground” – was celebrated initially by President George W. Bush in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/uncategorized/20-year-retrospective-reflecting-on-the-mission-accomplished-speech-and-its-aftermath/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“Mission Accomplished”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; speech, only to unravel in a fierce domestic insurgency that lasted for years, cost more than 4,000 American lives, and led – indirectly – to the rise of the Islamic State. The Kennedy administration backed a coup against South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963; Diem was later murdered, unrest followed, and in his memoirs, President Lyndon Johnson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/17/archives/memoir-terms-kennedy-role-in-diem-coup-a-blunder-book-terms-diem.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;blamed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the coup for the escalation of the Vietnam War. In Iran, the nationalization of the oil industry was at the heart of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;coup&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; orchestrated by the U.S. and Britain in 1953 to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh. That led to the return to power of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi – and ultimately to the revolution that brought an Islamic theocracy to power in Tehran in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I immediately am reminded of Iraq, where the military operation was well done and we removed Saddam Hussein pretty quickly in 2003, but then what came after was not great,” Glenn Corn, a former CIA Senior Executive, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “So I hope we've learned that lesson and we're not going to repeat the mistakes we made there.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salas noted that one lesson of the Iraq War involved the perils of driving out the remnants of an ousted regime. “The lesson learned in Iraq was when they attempted to expunge the Ba’ath Party, they realized that they had utter chaos because there was no one there to run the government, no one with experience,” he said. “You had the nation fracture into particular sections, regions, strongmen, military individuals, and others. If that happened in Venezuela, it would be chaotic. The country's very big, very diverse. It has oil regions, it has urban areas, it has an industrial base. So you could imagine that happening on a national scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some, the Maduro operation was reminiscent of an earlier era of American “gunboat diplomacy,” when the U.S. military was deployed regularly to seize territory and resources. The &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times’ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;David Sanger noted that Trump installed a portrait of William McKinley in the White House – and it was President McKinley who presided over the U.S. seizures of the Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. operation, in seeking to assert control over a vast Latin American nation, has little precedent in recent decades,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/us/politics/trump-venezuela-oil-risks.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sanger wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “recalling the imperial U.S. military efforts of the 19th and early 20th centuries in Mexico, Nicaragua and other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What comes next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the uncertainties of the moment, experts said the next phase in Venezuela will hinge on answers to several core questions: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does the Trump administration have an arrangement with Rodriguez and other Maduro regime officials to do the White House’s bidding? If not, how will the U.S. respond if they fail to oblige? Does the U.S. have a plan to remove those leaders? What might trigger that “second wave” Trump referred to, and the deployment of U.S. forces to the country? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What milestones must be met for the end of the interim period? Would elections follow – and would the U.S. organize or oversee those? What will the major U.S. oil companies do? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Uncertainties abound in Venezuela about what comes next,” Shifter said.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“For now, a framework of coerced cooperation between the Venezuelan regime, now led by Delcy Rodriguez, and the Trump administration, seems to be in effect. But it is far from clear whether that model is viable, much less sustainable.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fontaine said that “the default could well be to work with a compliant President Delcy and most of the existing government. It would be a head of state change more than regime change.” But he added that such an arrangement would do little to satisfy the opposition – the same people who have cheered the news of Maduro’s capture. “Many would-be supporters of this move hoped for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela, not just a different approach on drugs and oil.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that Trump was hardly the first president to decry nation-building projects, only to wind up taking them on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For 25 years, every U.S. president has opposed nation-building abroad and then gotten involved in it,” Fontaine said. “Trump, with the commitment to run Venezuela, appears to be the latest. The welcome fall of Maduro is not the end, or the beginning of the end, but the end of the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I've Tracked Terrorist Networks for Decades. I've Never Seen Anything Like 764.</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/764-terrorism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT PERSPECTIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;In 2021, a fifteen-year-old in a small Texas town started something from his bedroom. He’d dropped out of school. He spent his days online, deep into violence and gore. He found others like him and built a network. He named it after his ZIP code: &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/US/modern-day-terrorism-online-extremist-network-764-threatening/story?id=127528502&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;764&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within two years, it had spread to every continent. Members – a lot of them teenagers – were finding kids as young as nine on Minecraft and Roblox. They’d befriend them, earn their trust, then trap them. They forced children to hurt themselves on camera. To hurt animals. To do things I’m not going to describe here. That kid from Texas is serving eighty years now. But 764 didn’t stop. It splintered and kept growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://abc3340.com/news/nation-world/fbi-intensifies-crackdown-on-international-764-child-exploitation-network-crimes-kash-patel-children-federal-authorities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; currently has over 300 active cases in the U.S. – investigations running in every single field office across the country. They’re looking at more than 350 people tied to the network. Worldwide, authorities believe there are thousands of victims. Arrests connected to groups like 764 jumped nearly 500% in 2025 compared to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI ranks 764 as a “tier one” threat. That’s the same level as ISIS. Last year, Canada became the first country to officially call 764 a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/764-youth-extremist-group-9.7010571&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;terrorist organization&lt;/a&gt;. Not a crime ring. Not predators. Terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ran the State Department’s programs against violent extremism. I’ve studied how terrorist groups find and recruit people for most of my career. Canada got this one right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who’s Reading this? More than 500K of the most influential national security experts in the world. Need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;full access&lt;/a&gt; to what the Experts are reading?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Canada Did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling something a terrorist organization isn’t just a label. It changes what governments can do. In Canada, the designation means that anyone who helps 764 – with money, with recruitment, with anything – is now committing a crime. Banks have to freeze assets. Immigration can block people at the border. Law enforcement gets access to tools they can’t use for regular crimes. It also sends a message. When a country puts a group on the same list as Hezbollah and the Islamic State, it tells allies, tech companies, and the public: this is serious. Pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada’s intelligence service says nearly one in ten of their terrorism investigations now involves a minor. Think about that. We’re not talking about kids as victims – we’re talking about kids as suspects in terrorism cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How They Find Kids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;764 doesn’t stumble onto victims. &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/US/rare-public-comments-career-doj-officials-offer-chilling/story?id=128526657#:~:text=Epstein%20files%20so%20far%20don,years%20old%2C%20according%20to%20authorities.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;They go looking&lt;/a&gt; for specific kinds of kids. Depressed kids. Lonely ones. Kids who get picked on at school. Kids who cut themselves or post about wanting to disappear. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/31/far-right-extremists-games-platforms-radicalise-teenagers-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;They hunt for these signs in Discord servers, on Roblox, in Minecraft&lt;/a&gt; – places your kid probably hangs out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they find someone, they’re patient. They don’t ask for anything. They just show up. They say “I get it” and “you’re not crazy” and “I’ve been there.” If you’re a thirteen-year-old who feels invisible, having someone actually listen? That hits different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks go by. Maybe months. They share darker stuff. Normalize it. Then they ask for a photo – something the kid wouldn’t want anyone to see. Once they have that, everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Send more or we show everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most blackmail is about money. Not 764. They want content. They make kids film themselves getting hurt. Humiliated. Some get pushed toward suicide attempts—on camera, while the network watches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One mother told investigators her daughter carved a screen name into her arm with a razor blade. When she finished, the guy on the other end told her he loved her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her daughter said it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victims Become Recruiters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what turns 764 from a bunch of predators into an actual network. Members earn status by producing “content.” The worse the content, the higher they climb. They keep files on their victims – records of what they made them do—and trade them like trophies. Kids who started as victims become perpetrators because that’s how you move up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Connecticut, a former honor roll student got caught up in 764. She ended up making bomb threats against her own school – threats phoned in by someone overseas who she thought was her friend. When police searched her devices, they found abuse images, photos of self-harm, and pictures of her paying tribute to the network. Her mom told &lt;em&gt;ABC News&lt;/em&gt;, that “It was very difficult to process, because we didn’t raise her to engage in that kind of activity.” That’s the thing. Nobody raises their kid for this. These children get found, groomed, trapped, and turned. One researcher put it simply, “The most horrendous part is it’s minors doing this to minors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Is Terrorism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know – it sounds like the worst kind of predator ring. So why call it terrorism? Because it works exactly like the terrorist networks I’ve tracked for years. Find someone in pain. Give them a worldview that makes sense of that pain. Then get them to act on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2024/764-predator-discord-telegram/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;764 finds broken kids and tells them the world deserves to burn&lt;/a&gt;. That cruelty is honesty. That hurting people is power. The ideology underneath is simple: chaos for its own sake. No political demands. No territory. Just destruction as the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they turn victims into recruiters – kids climb the ranks by trapping other kids. The ones who got groomed become the groomers. And it doesn’t stay online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last July, a 764 member in Minnesota stabbed a woman twenty times. In Germany, authorities arrested someone connected to the network on over 120 charges — including murder. In Finland, police are investigating whether two teen suicides are linked to 764. The network shares guides on how to plan real-world attacks. This isn’t abuse that sometimes leads to terrorism. It’s a terrorism pipeline that uses child abuse as its on-ramp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the U.S. Hasn’t Moved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Canada calls this terrorism. Why haven’t we? Our laws weren’t built for this. We’ve got tools to go after foreign terrorist groups. We’ve got tools to prosecute child predators. But 764 started in Texas, spread everywhere, and mixes exploitation with extremism in ways that confuse the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, we’re going after these guys one at a time for the abuse. That puts individuals in prison. But it treats 764 like random criminals instead of a network with a shared playbook and a body count that keeps growing. The FBI calls it “one of the most disturbing things we’re seeing.” The Attorney General calls it “one of the most heinous online child exploitation enterprises we have ever encountered.” Meanwhile, kids keep getting trapped. The network keeps growing. And we keep treating each case like it exists in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada made a call. We should make the same one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cipher Brief Expert Dexter Ingram also publishes on Substack &lt;a href=&quot;https://dexteringram.substack.com/p/ive-tracked-terrorist-networks-for?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Code Name: Citizen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/dec/23/pope-leos-world-day-peace-opportunity-put-words-action/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are a lot of different accounts and issues that must be taken into consideration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela’s partners depend on it for various strategic reasons: &lt;strong&gt;Cuba&lt;/strong&gt; for economic support, &lt;strong&gt;Iran&lt;/strong&gt; for political alignment in Latin America, and &lt;strong&gt;China&lt;/strong&gt; for a notable share of its oil imports. The United States, meanwhile, is signaling a major shift in how it intends to assert influence in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cipher Brief Executive Editor Brad Christian talked with Roule, a leading global consultant on Middle East and Energy issues, about what is likely to happen next as the U.S. signals a major shift in how it intends to assert influence in the Western Hemisphere.

And I think the national security strategy is something that every one of the Cipher Brief's readers and listeners should pull out today. Look at it again, because I can assure you that policymakers around the world - in both our partner and adversary countries - are certainly doing so. If you look at events in Venezuela and read that national security strategy, a number of themes come forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. will be the dominant power in the Western hemisphere. In Venezuela, we saw a display of massive U.S. power and skill in the form of our military intelligence and technology. This is very similar to the display that the world witnessed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts-assess-strikes-response-and-what-comes-next&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Iran last June&lt;/a&gt;. So, this is coming very, very close to two sets of actions. And I think this is meant to be seen also, as the president alluded to in his press conference, as a visible reset of what he described as a previous erosion of U.S. military power in his predecessor's administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also showing that the U.S. is now capable of executing what was described by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as an extraordinarily large and complicated military and intelligence operation, without being leaked. This did not require foreign partners. And it also did not require the disruption of regional commercial air operations. If you listen to what the chairman talked about, this involved 150 aircraft from multiple locations descending upon another country. And other than closing the airspace for a short period of time, commercial air traffic was not disrupted. But you're seeing some other things that are also notable. The U.S. will undertake regime change when it perceives that the existing regime threatens core U.S. national security interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also represents another U.S. blow against a Chinese partner in the Western hemisphere following the Trump administration's actions in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policy-topics/international-relations-security/why-panama-canal-president-trumps&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;. The operation also took place on the anniversary of the killing of Iranian Quds Force leader General &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/soleimani-and-the-true-measure-of-deterrence&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Qassem Soleimani&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 as well as the surrender of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/january-3/noriega-surrenders-to-u-s&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Manuel Noriega&lt;/a&gt; in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are both examples of the long arm of the U.S. government. And certainly, the United States may have thought that the selection of this date would dampen any commemorations by the Iranian government for Soleimani's death in Tehran. Which would have been difficult enough given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/irans-protests-expose-deeper-fragility-as-leaders-struggle-to-contain-crisis&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;ongoing demonstrations&lt;/a&gt; in Tehran. But the ripples from this Venezuela operation will be global. And I think the national security strategy puts some meat on the bone with this operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: Just looking at the intelligence that was needed to pull off an operations like this for a moment, what do you think this says about U.S. intelligence and what would have gone into that for this particular operation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it tells you a couple of things. It tells you that first, the intelligence was exquisite and up to date. But it also tells you that the intelligence was integrated into the military operation with an intimacy, with care, so that our military personnel were able to move with extraordinary speed to get to the location as quickly as humanly possible. We've seen this in the past with the operation against Osama bin Laden. This is just another example of the close integration between the U.S. intelligence communication and our amazing and extraordinary special forces personnel. I can't speak highly enough of those extraordinary and humble operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also shows you the breadth of that intelligence community. The intelligence agencies that were cited included, the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). So, you're getting a sense of some very broad intelligence capabilities which were brought to bear and then integrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president, I believe, also mentioned that a house had been built in advance. I mean, you're just watching some incredible intelligence capability that was brought to bear by people on the ground over many months. It shows courage, it shows tenacity, it shows you the resources that were pulled together. And it also shows an ability to compartment this information and to prevent a leak. The U.S. government is doing what it's supposed to do. And in a world where we're often complaining about government, the American people and our partners should be gratified that our tax dollars are being well spent. And that the U.S. intelligence community and the military are performing superbly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

As an energy expert, can you share what’s top of mind for you on the broader impact on the oil and energy markets?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe the best way to answer that is to just explain a little bit about the Venezuelan oil system. First, the operation did not occur near Venezuelan oil production. Upstream oil operations are not located near Caracas, although exports and storage are highly sensitive to obviously, as you correctly put it, a U.S. maritime enforcement of a U.S. embargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of Venezuela's oil production, about two thirds, is derived from what is known as the Orinoco belt. And oil production from this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-31/venezuela-oil-output-slows-25-in-orinoco-belt-under-us-pressure&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Orinoco belt&lt;/a&gt; had fallen to about 498,000 barrels by the end of December, which is about a 25% drop from just a couple of weeks earlier. And it's been shutting down because they're running out of storage space because Venezuela can't export oil because of the blockade. So, they're trying to put the oil anywhere they can. They've put it in their own storage, they've put it in ships that are docked. They're putting it in almost in teacups at this point because they are running out of space to store the oil that they're producing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about the oil that is produced in Venezuela. They produce it from tar sands. It's extra heavy. It's a heavy type of crude oil and there are relatively few refineries that can process this grade of oil. It's difficult to extract. It's expensive to extract. Chinese refineries in 2025 tended to get a majority of Venezuelan exports. That amount ranged from 75 to 90% depending upon the amount. But even here, the Chinese tended to put much of that oil in their own storage. And China and Russia tend to be the two big players in Venezuela. For China, it is transactional. Chinese buyers look at it as a way to purchase cheap oil that they again put in storage. It's about 4% of China's exports and China again, has used a shadow fleet of intermediaries to purchase this oil. If China were to lose access to this, it's a problem. But because much of this has gone into storage and there are other suppliers out there in Saudi Arabia and other places, they could make this up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's a different story. Russia is an enabler of the Venezuelan oil industry. Because Venezuela's oil is so tar heavy, in essence, they need to import &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/science/naphtha&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;naphtha&lt;/a&gt; from Russia and this dilutes the ore and eco output and makes it blendable and then shippable. So, Russia sends in naphtha, it blends the stuff down and then stuff can then be exported. What would happen if suddenly Venezuela is opened up? Well, a couple of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, because the oil market is relatively well supplied, people would look at it and ask, ‘where are the investment opportunities?’ If you look at the places where the world has changed suddenly and investment opportunities occurred, production didn't dramatically change. Let's take Iraq and Libya for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Iraq, it took about a dozen years to get back to the level of pre-Saddam. And at that point, China was a major player. The U.S. is now returning to Iraq. In Libya, we're now a number of years after the fall of Gaddafi, and they are still about 25% below production levels under Gaddafi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And again, the U.S. is returning. Much of it does depend upon the security of the country and the stability of the country. So, the president's comments about running Venezuela the right way really does strike at the heart of what happens in the oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: Devil’s Advocate here: how does it compete with Texas’ output? What does the U.S. do with that oil? Is it going to be sold to China?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The president and the Secretary of State have talked about stolen oil. What does this refer to? Is there a U.S. case there? I'll leave it to others to talk about the amounts and so forth but when this is talked about, this refers to a 2007 Venezuela expropriation of what I believe was then Conoco Phillips or ExxonMobil investments. That Venezuela did indeed expropriate. So, there is indeed a legal case of Venezuela nationalization of U.S. assets for which the U.S. was not compensated. If Venezuela's government did change and if U.S. oil companies were to go in, could the oil industry be dramatically changed? Yes, but it would depend upon security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe my final comment would be that Chevron has been heavily invested there, and they have maintained a very mature and stable outlook for the country. If you hear Chevron’s CEO speak about Chevron's investments, they've been very levelheaded and unflappable about national security events. So, I think you're going to see them stay there as well. And I think when you listen to the president's comments about how the U.S. would run Venezuela, he seemed fairly confident that the U.S. oil industry would play a role there. Which makes one think that there have been some sort of discussions in this regard playing out in some way in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: At the most recent &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tcbconference.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cipher Brief Threat Conference&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, there was a lot of discussion around the idea of global conflict and some people believe that we are at the precipice of World War III. Certainly everyone agrees that global disruption is at fairly unprecedented levels. What is your thinking on this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We are in a different world, but we're in a world of permanent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/how-can-the-u-s-better-manage-the-gray-zone&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;gray zone conflict&lt;/a&gt;. But gray zone is defined and very, very differently. Gray zone was once defined by Iranian militias and it was defined by drone attacks or cyberattacks that were non-attributed. But we now have drone attacks or drone flights in Europe that come from God knows where, but they're Russian. We have Chinese routine harassment for more than a decade in the South China Sea. We have routine theft of intellectual property by China and North Korea, which in and of itself is a type of attack against our economy. But it's not necessarily a traditional gray zone attack. Because the people who are often involved in gray zone operations only see a certain number of colors on the palate. But the theft of intellectual property is just another form of attack.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're in that kind of a world and the people who are running the countries, they don't need to launch a war per se. They need to launch a series of short, sharp conflicts. Or short, sharp attacks. Now they said these could lead to a war if people believe we don't care about certain areas. And I do think there is the issue of what could happen in Taiwan in 2026. That should be a worry for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; on YouTube?

      <title>High Risk in Venezuela—To What End?</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/high-risk-venezuela-what-end</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“I knew the possible danger. It was a very dangerous operation. It was amazing that we had a few injured, but all are in good shape right now, but I knew there was great danger. You got off a helicopter. The helicopters were being shot out. They got on the ground amazing talent and tremendous patriotism, bravery. The bravery was incredible…They got off the helicopter and the bullets were flying all over the place. As you know, one of the helicopters got hit pretty badly, but that we got everything back. Got everything back and nobody killed,” meaning Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was President Donald Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/program/white-house-event/president-trump-speaks-with-reporters-aboard-air-force-one/671169&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;speaking Sunday&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aboard Air Force One on the way back from Florida about what he observed watching the early Saturday morning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-maduro-2026&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. raid in Caracas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While events in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-was-a-surprise-what-could-be-next&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Venezuela&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are still unfolding and I will discuss some below, I use that quote because it illustrates that deaths of American service members is one thing I believe is high in Trump’s mind as he has in recent months undertaken a series of worldwide military actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump almost regularly points out that no Americans have been killed in the four months the U.S. has been blowing up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/caribbean-double-tap-counternarcotics-strike&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;alleged narco-trafficking boats&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Crawford, who in the past had been assigned to represent defendants captured by the Coast Guard, who said the killing of crew members without prosecution amounted to very dangerous “political theater.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could say the same today for what I consider today’s ill-thought-out Trump actions in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What national security news are you missing today?

He then went on to say, &quot;I think it'd be very tough for her to be the leader. &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/7343295/venezuela-machado-trump-nobel-peace-prize/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;She doesn't have the support or the respect within the country&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. She's a very nice woman but she doesn't have the respect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I believe Trump meant was that the Maduro power structure – the Venezuelan Army, Bolivarian National Police and urban paramilitary networks known as &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;colectivos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; -- remain active and it is they that don’t “respect” Machado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also probably the reason there are no U.S. boots-on-the-ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Trump seems to believe that by keeping major U.S. military forces near Venezuela, he can threaten additional military attacks to keep the ex-Maduro crowd in line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Trump put it Sunday on Air Force One, “Venezuela thus far has been very nice, but it helps to have a force like we have. You know, we were ready for a second wave. We were all set to go, but we don't think we're going to need it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently it is Venezuela’s oil which is primarily on Trump’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with other matters, Trump seems to be living in the past as illustrated when he told reporters over the weekend, “We [the U.S.] had a lot of oil there [in Venezuela]. As you know they threw our companies out, and we want it back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationalization was the culmination of a decades-long effort by Venezuelan administrations of both the right and the left to bring under government control an industry that an earlier leader had largely given away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American oil companies, including Exxon and Mobil, which merged in 1999, and Gulf Oil, which became Chevron in 1984, were hit hardest. The Dutch giant Shell was also affected. The companies, which had accounted for more than 70 percent of crude oil production in Venezuela, lost roughly $5 billion in assets but were compensated just $1 billion each, according to news stories from that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Trump said, “The oil companies are ready to go. They're going to go in, they're going to rebuild the infrastructure. You know, we built it to start off with many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took it away. You can't do that. They can't do that with me. They did it with other presidents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to several sources, major oil companies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/business/venezuela-trump-oil-chevron&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;are not eager&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to spend the years and money at the present time to revive the Venezuelan oil industry, but as with much about the Venezuelan situation, there’s little yet that is predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One potentially dangerous outcome, looming already, is how Trump reads what he so far considers his military success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday he made &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/International/live-updates/venezuela-live-updates-trump-give-details-after-us?id=127792811&amp;amp;entryId=128901259&amp;amp;userab=abc_web_player-460*variant_b_abc_dmp-1901%2Cotv_web_player-461*variant_b_otv_dmp-1903%2Cotv_web_content_rec-445*variant_c_trending-1851%2Chp_banner-426*variant_a_control-1777&amp;amp;userab=abc_web_player-460*variant_b_abc_dmp-1901%2Cotv_web_player-461*variant_b_otv_dmp-1903%2Cotv_web_content_rec-445*variant_a_control-1849%2Chp_banner-426*variant_a_control-1777&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;open threats&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to both Colombia and Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He called Colombian President Gustavo Petro “a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States. And he's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as for Cuba, Trump said, “Cuba always survived because of Venezuela. Now, they won't have that money coming in. They won't have the income coming in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then went on to point out, “You know, a lot of Cubans were killed yesterday. You know that. A lot of Cubans were killed…There was a lot of death on the other side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then Trump quickly added, as I have pointed out before, “No death on our side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who's reading this? 500K+ dedicated national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Japan has so far taken an “innovation-first” approach to AI governance, avoiding stringent rules or penalties that could stifle adoption or experimentation.

      <title>Human Agency in a Technology-Mediated World</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/human-agency-in-a-technology-mediated-world</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT PERSPECTIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;Occasionally, a speech does more than mark a leadership transition or outline institutional priorities. It captures, with unusual clarity, the nature of the moment we are living through and the choices it demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blaise Metreweli’s recent inaugural address as Chief (or more colloquially, C) of the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service was one of those moments. Rather than offering a conventional tour of threats or capabilities, she chose a more demanding path. She spoke about human agency in a world increasingly shaped by machines. About trust, judgment, and integrity at a time when technology is accelerating every dimension of competition and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of working with Metreweli while serving as Deputy Director of the CIA for Digital Innovation. I watched her navigate the intersection of operations and technology with a rare combination of rigor and imagination. Her speech reflects that same sensibility. It is operationally grounded, intellectually disciplined, and quietly ambitious in what it asks of an intelligence service. Just as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What struck me most, reading her remarks, was not simply their alignment with themes I have been working on for years, both inside government and since my departure in 2024. It was the way she wove those themes together into a coherent vision of intelligence suited to the world as it is, not the world we might wish it to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the center of Metreweli’s speech is a proposition that may sound self-evident, yet is increasingly contested in practice: even in a technology-mediated world, human beings must still decide outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence can surface patterns, illuminate possibilities, even accelerate analysis. It cannot decide what matters. It cannot weigh moral tradeoffs. It cannot assume responsibility for consequences. Intelligence, in her framing, remains a human endeavor, even as it becomes ever more technologically enabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a conclusion I reached years ago while leading digital transformation efforts inside the CIA. As our tools became more powerful, the temptation to treat output as authority grew stronger. We resisted that instinct deliberately. The most effective systems we built were those designed explicitly to support human judgment, not replace it. They forced users to ask better questions or to challenge assumptions, and to understand context before acting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

The future of intelligence is not technological supremacy alone. Nor is it the return to a romanticized vision of the intelligence mission before the digital revolution. It is the disciplined integration of technology into human decision-making, with clarity about where judgment must reside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metreweli is equally clear about the character of modern conflict. We are no longer operating in a world neatly divided between war and peace. Instead, we inhabit a persistent space between the two, where states seek advantage through pressure that is continuous, deniable, and often difficult to attribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyber operations, sabotage, influence campaigns, and coercive economic measures all live comfortably in this grey zone. They are designed to intimidate and to erode confidence without triggering a conventional response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One aspect of this competition that deserves particular attention is the emergence of what I have called digital chokepoints. These are points of leverage embedded in digital infrastructure, data ecosystems, platforms, standards, and supply chains. They do not announce themselves boldly as instruments of power, yet they have increasingly come under attack in recent years as a tool of geopolitical competition. In 2024-2025 alone, there were numerous anomalous “incidents” that damaged or cut 13 undersea cables around Taiwan and the Baltic Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grey-zone conflict, viewed through this lens, is not episodic. It is cumulative. And we will see more of it. Intelligence services must therefore understand not just individual operations, but the architecture of pressure that builds quietly and persistently across domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The convergence of artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing, and the way these advances are reshaping both opportunity and risk was featured prominently in Metreweli’s speech. She avoids the dual traps of easy optimism and easy alarmism alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have often framed technology as both shield and sword. It accelerates intent, but it does not generally determine outcomes. Technology itself is neutral. What matters is how it is governed, deployed, and constrained by human choice, as well as which values are encoded into its digital foundations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction is not academic. The same AI system that accelerates medical discovery can enable surveillance at scale. The same digital infrastructure that connects societies can be (and is) used to monitor and control them. Metreweli’s speech is careful to emphasize mastery of technology alongside responsibility for its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That balance is essential. Technological determinism strips leaders of agency and excuses poor judgment. Metreweli’s approach does neither.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most sobering elements of Metreweli’s address is her discussion of trust. Information, once a unifying force, is now routinely weaponized. Falsehood spreads faster than fact. Algorithms reward outrage and reinforce bias. Shared reality seems increasingly elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have spent significant time in recent years examining the implications of synthetic media, deepfakes, and AI-enabled influence operations. Today, identity itself has become contested space. Voice, image, and presence can be fabricated convincingly and at scale. Seeing is no longer believing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This presents intelligence services with challenges that extend well beyond traditional counterintelligence or cyber defense. When trust collapses, when one can no longer discern truth from fiction, societies risk losing much more than confidence in institutions. They risk losing the ability to reason collectively about the world they inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metreweli’s insistence that defending the space where truth can still stand as a core intelligence mission reflects a deep understanding of what is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another strength of Metreweli’s speech is her refusal to treat today’s challenges as isolated problems. She describes an interlocking threat landscape that spans physical and digital domains, from seabed cables to space systems, from code to cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This holistic view is critical. Too often, Western governments have approached cross-domain issues in separate policy lanes. Next-generation communications, artificial intelligence, digital infrastructure, cyber intrusions, disinformation campaigns. All treated as distinct, individual issues. Our principal strategic competitor, the People’s Republic of China, has not made that mistake. These domains are understood as mutually reinforcing components of a comprehensive national digital strategy tied directly to a grand geopolitical ambition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

Countries around the world want to harness new technologies to accelerate development and improve lives. Many also want to protect sovereignty and human freedom. Meeting that demand requires seeing the digital contest as a whole, not as a collection of technical projects about which individual and disconnected policy decisions are made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though not stated in such terms, Metreweli’s framing reflects this reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an operational commander who became a technical leader, Metreweli brings unusual authority to her discussion of technology within intelligence tradecraft. She envisions a service where officers are as comfortable using digital tools as they are recruiting and running human sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not about turning intelligence officers into engineers. It is about understanding technology as both a tool and a terrain. Digital literacy becomes foundational, not because everyone must code, but because everyone must grasp how technology shapes the operational environment and adversary behavior. In modern intelligence, ignorance of technology becomes a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metreweli also speaks directly to the question of legitimacy. Intelligence services in democracies operate with extraordinary authorities. Their effectiveness ultimately depends on trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her commitment to openness, where it can responsibly exist, is not about transparency for its own sake. It is about sustaining a relationship with the public rooted in shared values. Accountability, in her formulation, is a strength, not a constraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a principle I championed consistently inside the Agency and since my departure. In democratic societies, trust can never be taken for granted. It must be earned and maintained, especially as intelligence services operate in the shadows, out of view of the citizens they serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particularly powerful portion of Metreweli’s speech focuses on audacity and “hustle,” reflecting a clear understanding of the environment intelligence services face today. In a world defined by exponential change, moving slowly does not preserve relevance. It accelerates decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have spoken often about urgency, about the reality that institutions unwilling to adapt will become obsolete. That does not mean abandoning discipline or ethics. It means recognizing that delay carries its own significant risks. In today’s dynamic, high-threat landscape, inaction is perhaps the biggest risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metreweli closes her speech where she began, with values. Courage. Creativity. Respect. Integrity. She recounts a conversation with a long-term foreign agent who worked with the UK precisely because of these values. This is not a sentimental anecdote. It is a strategic insight into how intelligence services in western democracies must navigate today’s complexity. Leveraging our core strength. Values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are living through the rise of digital authoritarianism, where technology is used to monitor, manipulate, and control populations at unprecedented scale. The most profound threat this poses is not technical. It is moral. It erodes human agency incrementally, often invisibly, until freedom becomes difficult to reclaim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have warned repeatedly that societies rarely lose freedom in dramatic moments. They lose it through systems that optimize for efficiency or security while stripping away consent, accountability, and choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metreweli’s insistence that none of us have a future without values is therefore a statement of strategic reality, and it gets to the very heart of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blaise Metreweli’s speech deserves close reading, not because it is eloquent (though it is), but because it is consequential. It articulates a vision of intelligence that is technologically fluent without being technologically captive, operationally aggressive without abandoning principle, and deeply human in a world that increasingly tempts us to forget what that means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For intelligence professionals, policymakers, and citizens alike, it is a reminder that even as our tools evolve, the most important choices remain ours to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full speech &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-by-blaise-metreweli-chief-of-sis-15-december-2025&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the US Government.

      <title>After Venezuela, What Is Next in 2026?</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-maduro-2026</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/new-york-ny-january-5-nicolas-maduro-and-his-wife-cilia-flores-are-seen-in-handcuffs-after-landing-at-a-manhattan-helipad.jpg?id=62661711&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C92%2C0%2C92&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CIPHER BRIEF EXPERT Q&amp;amp;A — &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;President Donald Trump said the U.S. is &quot;in charge&quot; in Venezuela after U.S. forces detained President &lt;strong&gt;Nicolas Maduro &lt;/strong&gt;on charges related to drug trafficking. President Trump is also demanding &quot;total access&quot; to Venezuela's oil infrastructure. Venezuela's de-facto leader &lt;strong&gt;Delcy Rodriguez &lt;/strong&gt;said Caracas is seeking &quot;balanced and respectful international relations&quot; with Washington.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intelligence professionals are reacting to this major development as it will have far-reaching consequences far beyond Venezuela, for the Western Hemisphere and elsewhere amid heightened tensions with adversaries such as Russia and China. Cipher Brief Executive Editor Brad Christian spoke with former CIA Senior Executive Paul Kolbe about what Maduro's capture signals for the national security landscape in 2026. The conversation has been lightly edited for length.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christian: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How are thinking about what just happened in Venezuela? What's top of mind for you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kolbe: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Venezuela has been a problem both for the United States and for the Venezuelan people for over 20 years. For the Chavez years and then the Maduro years, they've driven a country that was once one of the wealthiest in the world, and certainly wealthiest in South America, with unbelievable natural resources, particularly oil, and driven it into the ground through corruption, poor leadership, poor decisions, and oppression of the people. There's a reason eight million Venezuelans have fled the country. So, it's been a series of corrupt, horrible rulers. Not sorry to see Maduro go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela has also been a foothold for Cuba. Very important for Cuba in terms of the oil that they get there, but also as a place to plant the flag and spread Cuban revolution throughout South America. It's been a base and source of money and money laundering for Hezbollah and Iran. Russia has had a long-standing relationship with Chavez and with Maduro, supporting them with weapons, with intelligence, with the Wagner Group. So, Venezuela has been both a thorn in the side of the U.S., and has been involved in so many different things that are against our interests — not sorry to see Maduro go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

There had been talk even recently, just days ago, of the CIA being involved in a strike against a target in Venezuela. We don't often see a military operation of this complexity that goes this smoothly. What does that tell you about the intelligence that was at play here and the level of cooperation with the military?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kolbe: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Clearly it was highly professional and extraordinarily well-executed operation, both by the intelligence community and by the U.S. special operations forces that went in. Very pleased that there were no casualties, that we didn't suffer any losses. But the split that I would make is to ask if this is a very well-executed tactical operation that is without a larger strategy?  And if there's a larger strategy, what is it? In particular, what's the follow-on? There's been a number of times where we've gone in and broken things and not done such a great job of fixing them or just leaving. You can look at Libya, at Iraq, and other places where that's not happened. Some folks will point to Panama and Grenada and try to use those as analogies for Venezuela, and they're very different cases. Venezuela's not Panama — much bigger, much different set of dynamics there — and it's certainly not Grenada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the follow-on of who's going to rule, what the transition is, how do you maintain stability? The narco-traffickers are still there, the narco-syndicates, the military is still there, the street gangs are still there. The paramilitaries, which have been supported by the military and have acted as the chief arm of oppression and brutality against the people, they're still there. There's a lot of generals that have an awful lot to lose. So, unless there's been a negotiated handover of power, I don't quite understand, yet, how we're going to run the country without boots on the ground or without a clear negotiated handover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christian: Russia's been described as a special type of enabler for Venezuela over the years.  Russian officials have called the U.S. operation in Venezuela &quot;unlawful'' and a violation of norms. There have been other Russia developments related to Venezuela recently. The ship, Bella 1, that the United States has been pursuing for the last couple of weeks was reported to have painted a Russian flag on it's hull on Dec 31, and Russia reportedly has asked the United States to stop pursuing it.  What's your reaction to how Russia has publicly responded to these incidents?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kolbe: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I'll start with the irony of Russia's protestations against what they see as the invasion of sovereignty of another country and how awful that is put out there with no sense of irony. Russia is condemning something that is not analogous to what they've done in Ukraine, but also completely ignoring what they've done in Ukraine and the ongoing war that they continue to pursue against the Ukrainian people, against their infrastructure, against everything that stands there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, while Venezuela is going to capture a lot of attention over the next few days, I suspect that's also, perhaps, part of the purpose of it. It distracts from what I think is a far more strategic, far more important issue, i.e., What's going to happen in Ukraine in 2026? Will the U.S. abandon Ukraine? Will we stab them in the back, or will we be able to provide support that lets them fight Russia, preserve their sovereignty?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story with the ship is a pretty interesting one. It feels like watching a sea-born version of OJ Simpson's escape in his Ford Bronco as this Coast Guard cutter trails this gigantic oil freighter, which is running away at the speed of 11 knots and is now in the North Atlantic and is claiming to have Russian protection.  Russia has reportedly put out a diplomatic note dissuading the U.S. from taking any action on that. So it will be interesting to see what actually happens if the ship managed to make good on the escape or if we turn around and say, &quot;Oh, nevermind.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you Subscribed to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christian: At the most recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcbconference.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Threat Conference&lt;/a&gt; back in October, there was a lot of talk of global conflict. And some people use the phrase, &quot;World War III.&quot; Are we in it? Has it begun? There's been a lot of talk about gray zone, the level of gray zone activity, and the risk of major conflicts breaking out such as Taiwan or the situation in Europe growing beyond the borders of Ukraine. How are you thinking about the world as we start 2026 amid what is truly a dynamic national security backdrop?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kolbe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm thinking about it as we're in a state of conflict without recognizing it. Just a couple of days ago over New Year’s, you saw China mount a blockade exercise, clearly practicing for a coming blockade of Taiwan. The signaling coming out of there is ever sharper and, it’s always been clear, but suggests a narrowing timeline for action on Taiwan. I don't believe anything's imminent, but clearly they're building the capability and then the intent, the decision, once they have the capability, can happen at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a couple of days ago, we saw another communications cable cut between Estonia and Finland by a Russian ship that had left a Russian port that continues what is essentially low grade warfare on the European continent by Russia: sabotage, assassinations, misinformation, disinformation, and just a series of things which are clearly preparation of the battlefield, designed both to deter Europe and get Europe to self-deter, but also for the U.S., but also to put into place the capabilities that would be useful or used in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think what is clear to me is that we, the US — as stated in the National Security Strategy that came out in December — are basically carving out Latin America as a U.S. area of influence and seeming to leave Europe and Central Asia to Russia and East Asia to China. And for me, that's very disturbing that America First looks to be coming to include South America First.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/a&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In ousting and arresting Nicolás Maduro, US President Donald Trump wants the political gains of fighting a war without actually having to fight one. Whereas fascists and imperialists know that war requires real combat, Trump seems unwilling or unable to go that far, not least because he is weak at home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Venezuela was a Surprise. What Could be Next?</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-was-a-surprise-what-could-be-next</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CIPHER BRIEF EXPERT Q&amp;amp;A -- &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deposed Venezuelan President &lt;strong&gt;Nicolás Maduro&lt;/strong&gt; is scheduled to appear in a U.S. courtroom on Monday for the first time since being brought to New York to face &lt;strong&gt;narco-terrorism charges&lt;/strong&gt;. The brief hearing will formally begin what is expected to be a lengthy legal battle over whether he can be prosecuted in the United States.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This, as intelligence professionals are considering what the seemingly flawless U.S. military operation to detain Maduro could mean for what’s next in the region. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cipher Brief Executive Editor Brad Christian spoke with former CIA Senior Executive Glenn Corn about the impact of the Venezuelan operation and what we still don’t know. Their conversation has been lightly edited for length.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christian: Talk us through how you're reacting to the news of the last 72 hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corn:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; If I had a hat, I'd take it off to our former partner colleagues in the intelligence community and the special operations community. I mean, great operation. Well planned and executed. I'm sure that the intelligence had to be very good. Honestly, I'm proud because it's good to have a reminder that the U.S. can do this kind of thing. I don't want to go into the international law piece. I'm not a lawyer. But really a great operation and thanks to the people that put it together. You probably remember that we talked recently about the importance of the Western Hemisphere and reasserting some of our influence there and reminding people that, this is our backyard. This administration has made the Western Hemisphere a priority and I think it's a good thing. And here's an example of something that the president is willing to do. I give the president credit - this is a pretty bold move. And the timing was interesting. The other thing I'll say is no leaks, right? Which is also very, very good news because we have a problem in Washington with leaks, and the administration was able to keep this one under wraps. I was completely surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who’s Reading this? More than 500K of the most influential national security experts in the world. Need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;full access&lt;/a&gt; to what the Experts are reading?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christian: What do you think are going to be some of the things that you're going to be watching most closely? President Trump has said that the United States is going to be involved in administering Venezuela in the near term. There's been a lot of talk about reviving Venezuela's oil industry. Obviously, that's not surprising. There's been some reaction from American adversaries, but everyone's still in a watch and wait mode yet for how China and Russia is going to respond to this. What are you paying attention to in terms of signals for this week?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corn:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The president's comments about some type of U.S. administration, at least in some kind of transitory period were interesting. I immediately am reminded of Iraq where the military operation was well done and we removed Saddam Hussein pretty quickly in 2003, but then what came after was not great. So, I hope we've learned that lesson and we're not going to repeat the mistakes we made there. Hopefully there is a plan in place. The president indicated that some people in the administration are going to be giving roles also to help administer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s interesting that President Maduro and his wife were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/us-venezuela-strike-nicolas-maduro-captured-how-timeline-trump-rcna252041&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;detained&lt;/a&gt;, but it looks like everybody else is still in their roles which may be an indication that they learned the lesson from Iraq and our experience there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you're the Iranian supreme leader, you probably have to be very nervous right now. I went to bed thinking about Iran and what's happening there. And the president's comments that the U.S. will support those people that are coming out to peacefully protest and if they're... I forget his &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-trump-4e2232877bd1fff11cd80a33db47353d&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exact words&lt;/a&gt;, but basically, &quot;We will punish those who use force against them or who killed protestors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christian: The way I interpreted that was that the U.S. was prepared to intervene militarily to protect the protestors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corn:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; And we may still be. Last week, I was very focused on Iran, then all of a sudden over the weekend, this operation went down. Now, whether that's the intent or not, I don't know, but it’s really interesting timing. What comes next will be very important. I've been saying for a while that this administration has had some very good foreign policy successes in the last year, since coming to office. Generally, I think they're doing well on the foreign policy front. They've done some bold things. Syria, Azerbaijan, Armenia. Now what comes next is important, and then consistency is important. Do we have the ability to see it through? We’ll have to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christian: Russia is considered an ally to Venezuela. How might this impact Moscow’s foreign policy in the Western hemisphere, to include their planning and their ongoing operations as it relates to Venezuela or perhaps other parts of the Western hemisphere?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corn:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I think Putin has backed himself into a corner when it comes to a lot of these countries that he's aligned with. We saw that with Syria where he was overspent, and he really didn't have anything to help former President Bashar al-Assad when Assad was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/22/world/middleeast/assad-syria-exile-luxury.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in crisis&lt;/a&gt;. And one of his main allies in the Middle East is no longer there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Venezuela, the Russians have come out with some statements in support of Caracas, of Maduro, but they really haven't done much. There was some reporting last year, that Moscow was shipping more air defense systems and weapons to Maduro and the regime as we were ratcheting up our military activity in the Caribbean. But none of that seems to have made a real difference. Putin has to understand right now that he's been unable to come to Assad's assistance and with Maduro, his ally has just been removed and detained. So, he's got to be watching Iran very nervously because that's his other main ally in the Middle East and they've invested a lot in that relationship, and it seems like the Supreme Leader is in trouble right now. The regime is in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the President of the United States making bold comments about what the U.S. will do if the regime goes after protestors in Iran, it’s clear that Putin's influence is waning all over the world and he's eventually going to be unable to stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief applies expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Actually, it's looking now like the Russians are abandoning their allies. And I assess that's partly because of this quagmire that Putin got himself into in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe some of the Venezuelans who are celebrating the removal of their dictator should think about Ukraine and what the Ukrainians have done for them by stopping the Russian military the way they've done so effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also seems at first blush, that the intelligence services of Russia failed because it looks like this operation went down without any real warning to Maduro. And one would assess that if Putin is an ally of Maduro, he'd have tipped him off about the operation, which the Russians have tried to do in other circumstances in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, the Cuban bodyguards, what happened to them? Someone was telling me last week, that Maduro's main security force was made up of Cubans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think Putin has painted himself into a corner because I think he's afraid to really upset Trump because he knows that if Trump comes down hard on him on the Ukraine issue, he's in big trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's already in trouble. And many of us have assessed for a while that if President Trump decides that it's time to really ratchet up the heat on Moscow and the Kremlin, that will probably be a serious, serious blow to Putin and his power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christian: Do you believe that President Putin thinks he's backed into a corner in the way that you describe? And is it likely that there are people around him who may be telling him that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corn:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I don't even want to try to put myself in his head space. I've said for a long time, going back 10 years, that he's put himself in an information vacuum or echo chamber. So, who knows what he's thinking. But my guess is that he feels like he's backed into a corner. If you saw when the U.S. announced sanctions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2777&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gazprom&lt;/a&gt; and Lukoil, the first thing Putin did was send a delegate to the United States in a rush. That showed me panic and fear. And I'm sure that people around Putin are upset and worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, let's watch Iran. I think Iran's a big piece on the chess board, and we should see what happens there. I don't think that the Russians are going to be able to help much if the Iranian regime starts to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christian: The critics of the operation in Venezuela are saying things like, &quot;This is a bad precedent to set. Other leaders around the world may decide, 'Okay, well, if the U.S. can do something like this...'&quot; And obviously the criticism of this operation is it violates Venezuela's sovereignty. Do you worry about the knock-on effect and the second and third order effects of an operation like this being conducted by the United States, regardless of who's president, and being used in ways that may cause further instability in the world or being used by autocratic leaders or America's adversaries?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corn:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; No, I think that ship sailed a long time ago. This is not the first time the United States has done something like this. This is not the first time other countries have done something like this. Countries have made land grabs, have assassinated leaders or tried to remove leaders, overthrow governments. So, there's nothing new here. There's no new precedent here that I see. We've already started down this very ugly road. And to me, now, what's important is to make sure that our national security structure and our intelligence community and armed forces are fully armed and capable of dealing with any threat to U.S. interests and to our allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christian: At our most recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tcbconference.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cipher Brief Threat Conference&lt;/a&gt; in October, there was a lot of talk about global conflict. Some people use the phrase World War III. Do you believe it’s started and how are you thinking about 2026 from a national security standpoint?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corn:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Deterrence is critical right now. The U.S. has been deterred too much in the past, and we've been unable to deter our adversaries. It's very important that the U.S. maintains and demonstrates an ability to deter adversaries when they threaten our interests. The president is talking about U.S. oil companies going into Venezuela, rebuilding the infrastructure, reviving the Venezuelan oil industry, energy industry. I think this goes along with the administration's approach with commercial diplomacy, getting the U.S. business community actively involved around the world to help promote U.S. interests, which I support but you have to make sure that happens because you don't want vacuums to be created. A year ago in Syria, everybody was very excited about the opportunities, but those opportunities have been very hard to develop because of the realities on the ground. So, you need sustainment. You need the ability to really sustain and be patient and invest in taking advantage of opportunities and bringing some kind of economic development to regions that have suffered for a long time and are in very bad shape that are producing either jihadists or narco traffickers - probably because a lot of those people have no other choice to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You and I have both served in countries where that is the case, where the majority of people are not bad people, but they have no choice. There's really no option. We want to give them something better, right? But we have to do it. And that's going to be the big challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, kudos to the administration. This is part of a bigger game. I go back to the Reagan administration and the kind of rollback approach to the Soviet Union when Russia was challenging us around the world and Reagan finally responded to that by challenging them and calling out the Soviets where they were trying to poke on our interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would say that the Trump administration seems to be doing that, which is good, but we've got to be very, very cognizant of the fact that it's going to take a lot of investment and a lot of persistent attention to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Iranian regime collapses tomorrow, that could create a great opportunity or a vacuum. There’s a great opportunity in Venezuela right now. Let's take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as some early-20th-century German nationalists viewed Russia as a useful ally against more liberal European countries and the &quot;racially chaotic&quot; United States, the US under Donald Trump regards Russia and Hungary as friends united against a common enemy: Europe. There are several reasons for this reversal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building U.S. Drone Dominance Brick by Brick</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/drones-brick-by-brick</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;One of the things I loved about LEGO as a child was the ability to mix and match an endless amount of parts to create unique builds. Children (and some adults) gather around a bin of parts to create something new. Imagine being asked: “Build 10 houses in 30 minutes.” Everyone would come up with unique designs using various parts. Now, imagine a constraint: “You may only use red, 2x4, 2x2, and 1x2 bricks, white windows and doors, and it all has to fit on a green 32x32 baseplate.” Quickly, the limited supply causes a frantic scramble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scenario mirrors the recent call by the Department of War to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.army.mil/article/289322/war_department_asks_industry_to_make_more_than_300k_drones_quickly_cheaply&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;field 300,000 drones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over two years. The conflict in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/inside-ukraine-s-innovation-under-fire&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ukraine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exposed the U.S.'s lack of preparedness to equip forces with Purpose Built Attritable Systems (PBAS) at the scale of its peer competitors. Further, manufacturers are restricted by the requirement for critical components to be NDAA / BlueUAS compliant and, as of December 22nd, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-25-1086A1.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;even &lt;u&gt;more restrictions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which demand non-critical components be U.S.-manufactured. The defense industrial base is struggling to meet unprecedented demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While numerous startups and giants have stepped up, the U.S. supply chain cannot sustain the required pace. Existing suppliers’ manufacturing capabilities are quickly surpassed as companies scramble to design, build, and market the requested systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sUAS are fundamentally basic, consisting of a flight controller (FC), electronic speed controller (ESC), motors, propellers, camera, radio/video transmitters, receivers, and a frame. The main problem is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-drones-russia-china&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;availability of parts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and, more critically, sub-components needed to make them. Manufacturers are all reaching into the same scarce “bin,” forcing suppliers to seek materials with increased vigor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motors, for instance, require neodymium and copper. The majority of motor production occurs outside of the U.S., where technology is mature, labor costs are lower, and the supply chain exists. However, the sUAS industry accounts for less than 8% of neodymium consumption in the U.S. Returning to the LEGO analogy, if a child asks for more 1x1 red bricks to make houses, LEGO, which (in this scenario) makes over 90% of its money on other parts, has little incentive to retool for large-scale 1x1 brick production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, most FC and ESC boards are produced in Taiwan. While this was permissible under the original NDAA and BlueUAS frameworks, the new requirement for U.S. production necessitates standing up domestic manufacturing, likely to ensure production continues in the event that trade with Taiwan is disrupted. However, standing up U.S. companies, sourcing materials, hiring labor, and developing technology all create significant costs that are passed to the consumer. Since PBAS systems must remain &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;attritable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (affordable enough to be lost in combat), a higher cost per unit will force warfighters to be more judicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What national security news are you missing today?

There are a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentivize existing global manufacturers to stand up U.S.-based manufacturing. &lt;/strong&gt;Companies with existing technology, design, manufacturing, and supply chains should be incentivized to establish domestic production of like products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage raw material companies to invest upstream.&lt;/strong&gt; Critical material mining companies (e.g., for lithium and neodymium) currently lack incentive to ensure stable, consistent supply to manufacturers. Encouraging investment upstream offers supply chain guarantees for domestic manufacturing and additional revenue for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a “strategic reserve” of raw materials.&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. maintains strategic oil and gas reserves. For future conflicts, a strategic reserve of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/for-the-trump-administration-policy-often-involves-a-hunt-for-minerals&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;critical sUAS materials&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is vital given the global stranglehold countries like China have on the market to enable rapid manufacturing scale-up even if trade is disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase throughput of BlueUAS and NDAA compliant components from outside the U.S. &lt;/strong&gt;Maintaining U.S. connectivity to the global sUAS marketplace is important. While the restrictions are righteous, isolating U.S. production strains the raw material supply chain, causes allies to follow suit, and increases the overall cost per unit, reducing attritability. The U.S. should use the BlueUAS framework, with increased throughput, to identify compliant vendors across a wide section of allies and trade partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expedite current NDAA compliant components manufactured overseas through BlueUAS processes.&lt;/strong&gt; As manufacturing shifts to the U.S., the U.S. could provide ‘provisional’ BlueUAS certifications with limited durations to cover companies during the transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

Many companies cannot afford to stand up U.S. production, or the cost of compliance would render their price points untenable. This situation would likely result in defense giants acquiring the IP/technology from smaller companies at a steep discount, leveraging their supply networks, lobbying, and significant capital advantage to continue development and manufacturing under their umbrella, returning the U.S. defense ecosystem to its former exclusive state, prior to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/defense-acquisition-arsenal-freedom&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;recent tranche of reforms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is at a critical inflection point in its quest for American Drone Dominance. The foundation it establishes will define its final strength and resilience. Care must be taken to avoid supply chain degradation, continue providing affordable solutions for the warfighter, and remain flexible and responsive in future crises.

      <title>A Trained Eye Sees Strategic Patterns in Venezuela</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/a-trained-eye-sees-strategic-patterns-in-venezuela</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION&lt;/strong&gt; -- Venezuela presents a long-standing challenge tied to narcotics trafficking and transnational criminal networks. For years, the country has functioned as a major transit hub for illicit drug flows, money laundering, and organized crime, with direct consequences for U.S. domestic security and for stability across the Western Hemisphere. These realities alone justify sustained U.S. attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But criminal activity does not explain Venezuela’s full strategic significance. What distinguishes Venezuela today is not only the scale of illicit activity, but the conditions surrounding it: political isolation, economic dependence, weakened institutions, and contested legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conditions are familiar. These are precisely the environments external adversarial powers exploit in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/how-can-the-u-s-better-manage-the-gray-zone&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;gray zone&lt;/a&gt; to embed influence and preserve leverage without crossing the threshold of open conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In such settings, influence is not imposed abruptly. It is embedded gradually, normalized through routine engagement, and retained for use when pressure mounts. That method, rather than any single triggering event - is what places Venezuela squarely within the scope of longer-term U.S. strategic concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessing Venezuela this way does not require assumptions about covert orchestration or crisis direction by outside states. It requires recognizing a recurring competitive approach that has played out repeatedly in fragile and isolated systems: establish access early, avoid responsibility for governance, and preserve optionality as conditions deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief applies expert-level context to national and global security stories.

In states facing internal stress or external isolation, influence is rarely asserted through overt coercion. Instead, it is accumulated through sustained presence, access to institutions, and normalization of engagement — creating leverage that can be exercised selectively during moments of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern is not theoretical. It is consistent across actors and regions, even where tactics differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China: Economic and Technical Presence as Strategic Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China’s approach relies on economic and technical engagement as strategic infrastructure. Commercial projects, administrative systems, and digital platforms provide access long before crises emerge. Over time, this presence enables intelligence collection, political influence, and situational awareness without requiring overt security commitments or visible military footprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of this approach lies in patience. By embedding early and remaining engaged through periods of instability, China preserves optionality when political alignments shift or governance weakens. Influence accumulated quietly can later be activated to protect strategic equities, shape outcomes, or constrain competitors’ freedom of maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model avoids ownership. It does not require Beijing to stabilize fragile states or assume responsibility for their internal failures. Access is sufficient. Optionality is the objective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia: Security Engagement and Access Without Ownership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia applies a more security-centric variant of the same logic. Moscow’s engagement with sanctioned governments or non-recognized actors has repeatedly prioritized intelligence access, operational insight, and regional buffers rather than political alignment or long-term stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By maintaining relationships across formal and informal power structures, Russia ensures continued relevance during periods of transition or escalation. This posture allows Moscow to influence events without absorbing the costs associated with governance, reconstruction, or economic support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here again, the emphasis is not control but access. Engagement is calibrated to preserve leverage while avoiding entanglement — a model designed to expand or contract as circumstances dictate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iran: Network Persistence and Crisis Adaptability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran’s approach centers on the durability of networks rather than institutions. Elite cultivation, security penetration, and proxy relationships are established early and maintained quietly. When political systems weaken or collapse, these networks remain intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantage is resilience. Preexisting relationships allow rapid recalibration during crises without the need to rebuild influence under pressure. This approach is particularly effective in environments where authority is fragmented and legitimacy contested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across cases, Iran’s method demonstrates how influence survives regime change when it is rooted in people, systems, and incentives rather than formal state structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Analytic Distinction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across these approaches, a central distinction applies: Presence and enablement do not equal operational control. But sustained presence creates optionality — the ability to act, influence, or constrain outcomes when conditions shift. That optionality, accumulated quietly over time, is what allows external powers to convert instability into strategic advantage without triggering direct confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venezuela as a Permissive Strategic Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela now exhibits many of the conditions that have enabled this form of competition elsewhere. Politically, it remains isolated and internally polarized, with contested legitimacy and eroded institutions. Economically, it is dependent on external partners and vulnerable to leverage through finance, energy, and technology. Strategically, it occupies a sensitive position - proximate to the United States, central to regional migration flows, and endowed with significant energy resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open-source reporting has documented sustained external engagement consistent with these vulnerabilities. Chinese firms maintain long-term financial and energy exposure, while Chinese technology has been linked to state administrative and digital systems. Russia has pursued military cooperation and security ties with the Maduro government over several years. Iran has expanded defense-related cooperation, including activities now cited in U.S. sanctions actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this establishes direct operational control over events in Venezuela. That distinction matters. Modern competition does not depend on command-and-control relationships. It depends on positioning — ensuring access, protecting equities, and shaping the environment so that options exist when pressure mounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, Venezuela is not an abrupt escalation point. It is the maturation of a permissive environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. National Interests at Stake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viewed through this lens, the U.S. interests implicated extend beyond narcotics enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security and Intelligence Access: Adversarial access or technical presence in the Western Hemisphere creates intelligence and counterintelligence risks. Proximity amplifies the strategic consequences, particularly during crises when early warning and situational awareness are decisive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regional Stability: Venezuela’s instability already fuels migration flows, strains neighboring states, and sustains criminal economies. External actors that selectively stabilize the regime — without addressing governance or legitimacy - risk prolonging instability while insulating it from internal pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy and Economic Leverage: Venezuela’s energy sector remains strategically significant. External involvement that secures preferential access or shields operations from pressure can distort markets and complicate sanctions, reducing U.S. leverage over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alliances and Credibility: Regional partners watch not only U.S. actions, but their durability. Episodic pressure without strategic continuity reinforces perceptions that U.S. engagement is temporary, a perception that competitors routinely exploit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk of Tactical Action Without Strategic Effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military or law-enforcement action can disrupt illicit networks and impose immediate costs. But disruption alone rarely dismantles the access structures external powers cultivate over years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When political or economic stress intensifies, those structures often remain intact, allowing competitors to protect their equities and adapt quickly. Pressure that is not paired with a longer-term access-denial strategy risks plateauing or incentivizing deeper external involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Venezuela, criminal disruption addresses symptoms. It does not, by itself, degrade the political, economic, and intelligence ecosystems that enable adversarial positioning. Without sustained follow-through, tactical success can coexist with strategic stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative, Legitimacy, and the Competitive Space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition below the threshold of war is also a contest over legitimacy. External powers rarely challenge U.S. actions on operational grounds alone. Instead, they exploit ambiguity, sovereignty narratives, and perceptions of disproportion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These narratives gain traction when objectives appear narrow, temporary, or disconnected from a broader political strategy. Countering them does not require rhetorical escalation. It requires clarity, about purpose, duration, and the outcomes the United States seeks to prevent or enable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Implications Going Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela should be assessed as part of a broader competitive environment in which external actors exploit fragility, isolation, and economic dependence to secure enduring access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience from other regions points to several implications:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denying durable access matters more than disrupting individual activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time favors persistent presence over episodic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarity of purpose constrains adversarial narratives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regional confidence and allied coordination reduce competitive space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this environment, success is measured not only by disruption, but by whether competitors are prevented from converting instability into lasting advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela reinforces a familiar reality: in an era of competition below the threshold of war, strategic outcomes are shaped less by single actions than by whether access, influence, and legitimacy are denied over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US military operation to arrest Nicolás Maduro underscores President Donald Trump’s view of the Western Hemisphere as a region where US interests take precedence. Russia and China will welcome this as a sign that Trump shares their vision of a world divided into spheres of influence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For all Donald Trump’s talk about security, he proves far more interested in lining his own pockets. No country that hosts a major Trump-branded property or strikes a high-profile business deal with a member of Trump’s inner circle – including some with well-documented ties to global terrorism – faces US travel restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The current wave of hyper-nationalism reflects growing anxiety over a deeply interconnected global economy that no longer fits neatly within political borders. While a world without nation-states remains a distant dream, we can at least strengthen existing supranational organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the race to dominate AI has so far focused on cutting-edge chips and capital expenditures, all the data centers in the world will not help you if they lack a continuous supply of affordable energy.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump claims that Europeans are engaging in &quot;censorship&quot; when they require digital platforms to be transparent about their algorithms and to remove already illegal content. With the US recently barring entry to five Europeans it accuses of regulating online content, it is time to set the record straight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Iran’s Protests Expose Deeper Fragility as Leaders Struggle to Contain Crisis</title>

Several other incidents of violence were reported in western and southern regions, but independent verification remains difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Masoud Pezeshkian, traveling in southwestern and eastern Iran, has acknowledged mounting public dissatisfaction and urged officials to address the population’s concerns, calling mismanagement - not foreign adversaries - the primary cause of the crisis. His remarks contrasted with harder-line figures who continue to blame unnamed “enemies” for the unrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest protests began after the Iranian rial plunged to &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;record lows&lt;/a&gt;, prompting the resignation of Central Bank Governor Mohammad Reza Farzin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader economic backdrop is bleak: inflation remains above 40 percent, food and household costs have surged, and nearly every major sector outside oil is contracting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ongoing, still relatively small, economic protests now unfolding in several cities in Iran are the latest indicator of the Islamic Republic's fragility,” Middle East Expert and former National Security Manager for Iran at ODNI, Norm Roule tells &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roule explains in this exclusive Cipher Brief analysis, why he believes the latest protests are likely a sign of what could be waiting for Tehran in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;expert-block-container expert-list&quot;&gt;

          Norman Roule is a geopolitical and energy consultant who served for 34 years in the Central Intelligence Agency, managing numerous programs relating to Iran and the Middle East. He also served as the National Intelligence Manager for Iran (NIM-I)\n at ODNI, where he was responsible for all aspects of national intelligence policy related to Iran.
    	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANALYSIS -- “Since 2017, Tehran’s domestic oppression, persistent inflation, declining standards of living, international isolation, and weak domestic policy credibility have produced periods of sharp and widespread unrest. Iran’s security forces have responded brutally. But the protests have shattered the Islamic Republic’s political self-confidence. Tehran’s response to the ongoing demonstrations reflects that mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A regime that once boasted that its high national election turnout reflected the support of its people is now unable to hide historic low voter turnout and accepts the threat of destabilizing national unrest as an inevitable consequence of life in modern-day Iran. Economic challenges are not the regime’s only concern. Iran’s historic drought and other environmental problems persist. Winter saw a sharp decline in air quality in large areas of Tehran, Khuzestan, and Isfahan provinces. In early December, Iran’s health minister announced that ongoing air pollution problems had sent more than 170,000 Iranians to emergency wards with heart and respiratory problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the current unrest expands or dissipates - like prior waves of protest - remains uncertain. What is clearer is that the underlying drivers are durable, making future episodes virtually certain. The more consequential question is whether disillusionment will remain confined to civilians or will begin to test the cohesion and confidence of the security forces the Islamic Republic has relied upon for so many years to contain dissent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing collapse of Iran’s currency, the rial, ignited the protests this week. After the currency fell as low as 1.42 million per dollar, Central Bank Governor Mohammad Reza Farzin resigned. The magnitude of the slide is best understood with some history: In 1979, the Iranian rial stood at 72 to the dollar. On July 14, 2015, the day the Iran nuclear deal was signed in Vienna, the Iranian rial was at 29,500 per dollar. When Farzin entered office in December 2022, the rial traded at about 430,000 to the dollar. Whatever the precise benchmarks, the trend is unmistakable: the rial’s weakness has become both a symbol of policy failure and a driver of unrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The currency’s decline has coincided with bleak economic signals. Except for anemic growth in the oil sector, every key sector of Iran’s economy is entering recession, foreshadowing higher unemployment. Industry and mining declined by 3.4%, construction by 12.9% and agriculture contracted by 2.9%. At the same time, inflation is growing. The Statistical Center of Iran (SCI) reported that Iran’s average annual inflation reached 42.2% in December. A close examination of this number indicates the significant impact of inflation on Iranian consumers. Food, tobacco, and beverages rose 72% year over year. This persistent high inflation erodes the purchasing power of Iranians and drives an increasing number into poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tehran’s options are few. Iran’s problems are deep and structural, and durable improvement would require political and ideological shifts beyond what the Pezeshkian administration is likely able to deliver. Even so, the government will be compelled to act on three fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, Farzin’s resignation provides the president with a convenient focal point for public anger, but it does nothing to address the issues that precipitated the crisis: fiscal mismanagement, sanctions pressure, and chronic credibility deficits. President Pezeshkian has reportedly selected 64-year-old former economy minister Abdolnaser Hemmati as Farzin’s successor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemmati may at first seem a counterintuitive choice, given that the Iranian Parliament impeached him in March for failing in similar circumstances. However, he has a background that offers potential for stability. First, he is experienced. He led the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) from 2018 until late May 2021, during the Trump administration's earlier sanctions, and his work helped stabilize the foreign exchange market under similar difficult circumstances. He also qualifies as a regime insider with decades of experience with hardliners and more pragmatic conservatives. After beginning his career as an agricultural economist, he moved to Iran’s broadcasting organization, where he rose to become its political deputy and director general of news broadcasting. He then became the Director of Iran’s Central Insurance Corporation. Between 2006 and 2016, Hemmati led Sina Bank and Bank Mellat, banks with close ties to the Revolutionary Guard's Qods Force, to the extent that the U.S. and the European Union designated each. Hemmati attempted to enter the 2024 presidential election on a platform offering economic stabilization, but the Guardian Council rejected his candidacy. He instead became Pezeshkian’s economy minister, a position he held until his impeachment on 2 March 2024, following a spike in inflation and the rial's fall to 950,000 to the dollar. Ironically, that value would be seen as a significant improvement in its status today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemmati will need to work quickly with Pezeshkian to propose measures to decelerate inflation, with an emphasis on protecting low-income and rural households. In the medium term, Hemmati will need to target Iran’s banking sector to strengthen balance sheets and prevent further failures. The downside of this last step is that it will inevitably involve some recognition of bad loans and credit tightening to prevent additional poor loan issuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Pezeshkian will focus on budget reform. Details on his latest budget are limited, but we know that security and military entities remain well-resourced, which will constrain his options on the civilian side. He has proposed a 20% salary increase for public workers, but it will not keep up with inflation, and even here, he will struggle to find the funds. The budget debate will continue until 20 March 2026, and will likely remain contentious, given its emphasis on tax collection and subsidy cuts rather than oil revenues as a source of income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, foreign policy will remain the most complicated aspect of Pezeshkian’s economic challenges. His government will do whatever it can to mitigate the impact of sanctions through engagement with Russia, China, and Africa, and will continue to seek talks with Washington. Initiating negotiations with the U.S., even without a prospect of an outcome, has in the past strengthened the rial. But if Pezeshkian would welcome talks with the West, the hardline actors within the regime responsible for Iran’s foreign policy remain focused on aggressive goals that remain one of the primary obstacles to peace in the region. The Quds Force shows every sign of seeking to rebuild its shattered proxies and establish new relationships with the Khartoum and other actors in Africa. The Trump administration’s approach to Tehran has been consistent. It will not waste time on talks that offer sanctions relief without seismic changes in the regime’s approach to nuclear, missiles, and regional issues. Gulf Arabs are willing to maintain a strategy of détente but will not consider rapprochement without an end to Qods Force activity in the region. Absent political rapprochement and a belief that capital invested in Iran will not be subject to terrorism or human rights sanctions, foreign investment for Iran will remain impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, Iran’s leaders will inevitably recognize that this unrest is unfolding amid several hallmarks of a pre-revolutionary situation: institutional failure, fragmentation among the ruling elites, generational alienation, persistent fiscal crisis, widespread economic suffering, class antagonism, escalating and chronic protests, and the absence of a unifying state narrative. President Pezeshkian recently stated that his country was “in a full-fledged war with America, Israel, and Europe.” Such rhetoric will play to domestic hardline audiences while reinforcing Iran’s aggressive reputation abroad. During this sensitive period, Iran is unlikely to take actions that would further exacerbate its domestic fragility and instead seeks to gradually test Western red lines while navigating the Islamic Republic through what remains the regime's most sensitive and challenging economic and political period since the 1980s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube?

      <title>Putin Again Bungles Strategy: Why His War of Attrition will Sink Russia</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/putin-ukraine-war-sink-russia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;On February 14, 2022, with Russia poised to invade Ukraine, I questioned whether Vladimir Putin’s reign to that point had revealed him to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/is-the-russian-president-a-strategic-master-or-a-strategic-failure&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;strategic master or a strategic failure&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly four years later, the verdict is even more apparent. Putin, confident in his strategic calculus that the West would provide only token assistance to Ukraine, which would quickly fold under the weight and violence of Russian military might, fatefully launched his attack days later with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/putin-strategic-failure-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;disastrous consequences for Russia&lt;/a&gt;. The country he leads is now even poorer, more isolated, brittle, and dependent (on China) than before. Putin grossly underestimated Ukrainian will, overestimated the competence of his own military and intelligence apparatus, and misjudged Western cohesion. By the Fall of 2022, it was obvious even to Putin that his expected quick victory was unattainable. This was surely a bitter pill to swallow, but he quickly pivoted to a “wait and win” war strategy of grinding attrition, calculating that through sheer mass and perseverance--and Western impatience--time would be on his side. Most pundits, even those in the West, have tended to agree with him, much as they did in 2022 about the likelihood that Russia would quickly roll over Ukraine. This mindset, however--that time is on Russia’s side--risks a strategic misreading no less profound than his original blunder, because there is a strong argument to be made that Putin’s attrition strategy is eroding key foundations of Russian power faster and more deeply than it is eroding the Ukrainian front lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus far Russia has managed to sustain a high level of war spending, but there are growing signs of strain. Russia’s numerical troop advantage over Ukraine is maintained almost entirely through extraordinarily high financial incentives, but these are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euronews.com/2025/12/02/russia-cuts-troop-bonuses-and-delays-death-benefits-amid-budget-shortfalls&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;starting to drop steeply&lt;/a&gt; due to growing budget shortfalls, particularly in regional budgets on which such spending disproportionately falls. New contracts for soldiers in April-June 2025 were less than half the level of the same period in 2024, signaling a significant weakening in the effectiveness of financial inducements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just the money. The death toll for Russian soldiers is accelerating. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/07/secretary-of-state-marco-rubios-remarks-to-the-press-at-the-kuala-lumpur-convention-center&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stated in July of this year&lt;/a&gt; that the number of Russian dead for the first half of 2025 alone exceeded 100,000. This has likely contributed to a sharp increase in desertions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontelligence.substack.com/p/silent-exodus-rising-desertions-in&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;estimated to have doubled in 2025&lt;/a&gt; with approximately 70,000 desertions, or approximately 10% of the force in Ukraine. Russia is increasingly reliant on coerced recruits, harsh punishments for desertion, including torture and extrajudicial executions, all signs of a military struggling to maintain sustainable, motivated troop levels. While tactical adaptations have allowed Russian forces to regain some initiative on the battlefield, they rest on a manpower model that burns through human capital, i.e., human beings, at a pace no country with Russia’s demographic profile can long sustain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who’s Reading this? More than 500K of the most influential national security experts in the world. Need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;full access&lt;/a&gt; to what the Experts are reading?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the war drags on, Russia is also becoming even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/china-russia-relationship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more dependent on China&lt;/a&gt;. Post-2022 trade patterns show a Russia increasingly locked into an asymmetric partnership in which Russia humiliatingly relies on China for critical imports of technology, while Beijing gains leverage through discounted energy purchases and control over supply chains, making Moscow increasingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/china-is-russias-crutch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vulnerable to Beijing’s whims&lt;/a&gt; over time. For a leader obsessed with sovereignty, the long-term trajectory Putin has embarked on contains a glaring paradox: the longer he fights to keep Ukraine out of the Western orbit, the more he locks Russia into a subordinate position in China’s. Talk about strategic irony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These financial strains and deepening dependence on China are compounded by the continued tightening of international sanctions on the Russian energy sector, a general decrease in the price of oil and gas on which Russia is so heavily dependent as the global economy cools, and the heavy depletion of Russia’s “rainy day” sovereign wealth fund, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/russia-tomorrow/the-russian-economy-in-2025-between-stagnation-and-militarization/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;which has dropped by almost 60%&lt;/a&gt; and now mostly consists of Chinese Renminbi and gold, having exhausted its hard currency holdings. Maintaining current defense spending will thus increasingly require either higher borrowing from domestic banks or visible cuts in social spending and civilian projects, further eroding living standards and stoking popular war fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin’s war-of-choice with Ukraine has only intensified Russia’s pre-war weaknesses. Russia’s economy, already underperforming relative to its resource base and human potential, must now deal with permanent war spending and sanctions-induced inefficiencies. Its demographics, already fragile, are being further hollowed out by horrific war casualties and the emigration of skilled workers. Russia’s civic life, already stunted, is being further smothered by wartime repression. Finally, Putin’s invasion not only failed to restore a pliant Ukrainian “little brother”, it locked Russia into a costly struggle against the second largest country in Europe, after itself, and one that is moreover more anti-Russian, better armed, and more deeply integrated with the West than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

He underestimates the cumulative effect of casualties and consequences of economic distortions and social fatigue inside Russia; he overestimates the degree that support of the Western democracies for Ukraine will collapse under the weight of their debates and divisions; and he also, again, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/perhaps-ukraines-most-dangerous-time&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;overestimates&lt;/a&gt; his ability to break Ukraine by military force. In analyzing the arc of Putin’s rule, the war in Ukraine is not an aberration from Putinism, but its logical culmination. In strategic terms, it represents a transition from a condition of chronic underperformance to one of active and acute self-harm. Nearly four years after his decision to invade Ukraine, which more than anything else will define his reign, Putin is not outplaying history on a grand chessboard by doubling down on the war, he is sacrificing Russia’s future for the sake of victories and imperial fantasies that cannot be won, much less sustained. This is the definition of strategic failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a self-proclaimed student of Russian history, Putin would be wise to remember the setting of Russia’s original regime-toppling “color revolution,” the February Revolution of 1917. This was the spontaneous Russian popular uprising that led to the abdication of the Tsar and formation of a Provisional Government, not the subsequent Bolshevik coup d’etat later that year. While popular discontent with the monarchy had long been rising, it was the accumulated privations of war that brought events to a boiling point. As with that war, time in this one is not on Putin’s side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a tumultuous 12 months for the US economy, the coming year may well be marked by even greater upheaval. From the likelihood that President Donald Trump’s tariff chickens will come home to roost to the risk of a stock-market crash, there is good reason to fear that the global economy’s most powerful engine may stall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
