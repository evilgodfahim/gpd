      <description>&lt;p&gt;While many commentators have criticized Argentine President Javier Milei's draconian approach to economic reform, the results of the October legislative election show that the Argentine people would prefer short-term economic pain over a return to Peronist policies. Milei now has a clear path to finish what he started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US airstrikes in the Caribbean reflect President Donald Trump’s view of intra-American relations as hierarchical.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The belief that members of political dynasties are uniquely suited to lead is woven deeply into the fabric of Indian governance, from village councils to the highest echelons of parliament. But when elected office is treated like a family heirloom, the quality of governance inevitably suffers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is training the press and the American people to associate the military strikes on small boats in international waters with stopping the flow of fentanyl and other drugs. This mendacity is a prime example of the falsehoods that imperialists tell before launching doomed wars of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of increasingly hostile rhetoric from US officials about China, highly authoritative voices in the United States have suddenly become less hawkish, and the Trump administration has begun to pursue new trade negotiations in earnest.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As traditional donors slash foreign-aid budgets, developing countries must mobilize a broader range of financing sources.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may have delivered a kind of détente, after months of escalating tariff threats by the United States and retaliatory restrictions on rare-earth exports by China. While China had good reason to de-escalate the conflict with the US, however, it remains beset by political and economic weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After US President Donald Trump's trip to the region, one could be forgiven for concluding that the &quot;pivot to Asia&quot; begun when Barack Obama was in the White House has been replaced by a pivot to the Western Hemisphere. Needless to say, this is not the pivot America’s friends and allies in Asia were and are counting on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With its GNI per capita having increased steadily in recent years, China has probably evaded the middle-income trap. But the country may yet find itself ensnared in a kind of economic Thucydides trap: attempting to surpass an incumbent hegemon bent on keeping it down – and never quite succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the US Supreme Court upholds President Donald Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on US allies and adversaries alike, it will hand a loaded gun to future presidents. Why couldn't an administration use IEEPA tools to enforce a global minimum corporate tax or effectively ban crypto trading?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a book released earlier this year, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson argue essentially for “competent capacity”: a US that can effectively plan, approve, and execute projects. That is a worthy goal, but “abundance” is probably not the clearest way to convey it, let alone the most effective means of achieving it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new report shows that the integration of climate objectives and social-protection systems can go a long way toward delivering finance where it is needed most. But making the most of these findings will require a new approach to designing, financing, and implementing social-protection programs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The costs of decarbonizing the four highest-emitting sectors in China dwarf those in other major emerging economies, with India coming in a distant second. But while the figures might seem daunting, they are well within reach for China, which should be able to meet its own climate-finance needs relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While most people regard the Sino-American rivalry as a new cold war between two world-bestriding giants, the truth is that both countries are tightly constrained. Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping each sense the other side's vulnerabilities, which means they cannot hide their own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To rebuild the middle class, reduce global poverty, and address climate change simultaneously, we need to depart from established ways of thinking and consider new approaches. Fortunately, many of these approaches already exist at the local level, where they have proved themselves and need only to be recognized.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Western leaders favor the language of “polycrisis” because it obscures the root cause of our current predicament: the industrial-colonial paradigm. Instead of focusing on fear, the world must study and tackle development challenges with a purposeful realism that draws on the creativity of a genuinely global community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Russians were promised a quick victory in Ukraine; instead, they have gotten a protracted and costly conflict reminiscent of the Afghan quagmire that contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. None of this is lost on President Vladimir Putin, who is ramping up prosecutions to eliminate potential rivals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the absence of political will, the law has become a crucial driver of climate progress. Recent rulings make it clear that countries have binding legal duties to cut emissions, phase out fossil fuels, and finance adaptation efforts, laying the groundwork for stronger commitments at COP30.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When millions of protesters came out this month to say, “No Kings,” Donald Trump posted an AI-generated video of himself being crowned, only to insist, the next day, that he is not a king.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While many commentators warn that AI will undermine employment and offer only modest productivity gains, empirical studies continue to suggest otherwise.

The illusion of the strong man who will fix everything cannot be dispelled by reviving the illusion that oligarchy offers the population democratic choices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As companies seek to automate repetitive tasks in the name of cost-cutting, they should consider the longer-term implications. If we transfer all codified knowledge to machines, we will bequeath to future generations a world where it will be ever harder to learn by doing, to achieve mastery, and thus to aspire to creative freedom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the US Federal Trade Commission freed millions of Americans from a powerful constraint on their labor-market mobility by banning non-compete clauses for most workers. It was one of the biggest policy wins for American workers in recent years – and, because of Donald Trump's administration, it may never take effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few ideas in economics have been as misrepresented as the link between debt and growth. More than a decade ago, a prominent analysis was falsely cast as a call for austerity when, in fact, it showed something far more mundane: countries burdened by heavy debt often have limited room to invest or respond when crises strike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The cycle of rise and decline over the centuries has established some basic tenets of power, including that civilizations can still collapse even when they are set up for success.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Western countries have been generous in supporting Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, their financial assistance can be used only for non-military purposes. Instead of deploying aid this way, which creates distortions that undermine Ukraine’s war effort, foreign donors should directly fund defense spending.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
