      <title>The Energy Transition Is Achievable in Emerging Markets</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A decade or so ago, a consensus emerged that the energy transition would require massive amounts of capital. But, according to new research into high-emitting sectors in nine major emerging-market economies, power generation will require the least amount of climate finance to shift from fossil fuels to renewables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whereas the conventional wisdom holds that the US depends on Chinese rare earths, putting it at a severe geopolitical disadvantage, it is actually China that depends on the US (and others) for higher value-added rare-earth compounds. Any Chinese restrictions on rare-earth exports are thus likely to hurt China most of all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The current geopolitical environment is arguably not conducive to pursuing reparations for slavery and colonialism. But Africa and its diaspora in the Americas, the Caribbean, and Europe continue to make headway, with a focus not only on seeking financial compensation but also on ending racial discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Japan’s first female prime minister, Takaichi Sanae, presents herself as a leader who can be tougher than the men. This, combined with her hawkish views on immigration and defense, suggests that Takaichi will not use her position to help other women crack the glass ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the economic consensus for the US economy anticipates moderate, steady GDP growth and inflation heading toward 2%, the recent strength of both gold and tech stocks is a signal that investors should not ignore.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adam Smith favored neither state socialism nor unbridled markets, but something subtler: a moral economy grounded in sympathy and the pursuit of human flourishing. In a world where markets look increasingly unmoored from ethics, we could do worse than to revisit what the &quot;founding father&quot; of economics actually wrote.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While many commentators have criticized Argentine President Javier Milei's draconian approach to economic reform, the results of the October legislative election show that the Argentine people would prefer short-term economic pain over a return to Peronist policies.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US airstrikes in the Caribbean reflect President Donald Trump’s view of intra-American relations as hierarchical.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The belief that members of political dynasties are uniquely suited to lead is woven deeply into the fabric of Indian governance, from village councils to the highest echelons of parliament. But when elected office is treated like a family heirloom, the quality of governance inevitably suffers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is training the press and the American people to associate the military strikes on small boats in international waters with stopping the flow of fentanyl and other drugs. This mendacity is a prime example of the falsehoods that imperialists tell before launching doomed wars of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may have delivered a kind of détente, after months of escalating tariff threats by the United States and retaliatory restrictions on rare-earth exports by China. While China had good reason to de-escalate the conflict with the US, however, it remains beset by political and economic weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After US President Donald Trump's trip to the region, one could be forgiven for concluding that the &quot;pivot to Asia&quot; begun when Barack Obama was in the White House has been replaced by a pivot to the Western Hemisphere. Needless to say, this is not the pivot America’s friends and allies in Asia were and are counting on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With its GNI per capita having increased steadily in recent years, China has probably evaded the middle-income trap. But the country may yet find itself ensnared in a kind of economic Thucydides trap: attempting to surpass an incumbent hegemon bent on keeping it down – and never quite succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the US Supreme Court upholds President Donald Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on US allies and adversaries alike, it will hand a loaded gun to future presidents. Why couldn't an administration use IEEPA tools to enforce a global minimum corporate tax or effectively ban crypto trading?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a book released earlier this year, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson argue essentially for “competent capacity”: a US that can effectively plan, approve, and execute projects. That is a worthy goal, but “abundance” is probably not the clearest way to convey it, let alone the most effective means of achieving it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new report shows that the integration of climate objectives and social-protection systems can go a long way toward delivering finance where it is needed most. But making the most of these findings will require a new approach to designing, financing, and implementing social-protection programs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The costs of decarbonizing the four highest-emitting sectors in China dwarf those in other major emerging economies, with India coming in a distant second. But while the figures might seem daunting, they are well within reach for China, which should be able to meet its own climate-finance needs relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While most people regard the Sino-American rivalry as a new cold war between two world-bestriding giants, the truth is that both countries are tightly constrained. Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping each sense the other side's vulnerabilities, which means they cannot hide their own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Western leaders favor the language of “polycrisis” because it obscures the root cause of our current predicament: the industrial-colonial paradigm. Instead of focusing on fear, the world must study and tackle development challenges with a purposeful realism that draws on the creativity of a genuinely global community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the US Federal Trade Commission freed millions of Americans from a powerful constraint on their labor-market mobility by banning non-compete clauses for most workers. It was one of the biggest policy wins for American workers in recent years – and, because of Donald Trump's administration, it may never take effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why did Germany, defeated in both World War I and WWII, recover so strongly after the latter, but not after the former? Two new books suggest that conventional accounts of the Wirtschaftswunder – West Germany’s miraculous economic ascent after WWII – get it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Western countries have been generous in supporting Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, their financial assistance can be used only for non-military purposes. Instead of deploying aid this way, which creates distortions that undermine Ukraine’s war effort, foreign donors should directly fund defense spending.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Africans Want from COP30</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Instead of continuing to wait for aid, Africa is seeking to mobilize investment in its green transition, not because rich countries “owe” Africans – though they do – but because Africa can help the world tackle climate change. Success will require progress on four fronts, all of which will be addressed at COP30.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
