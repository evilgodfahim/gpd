      <title>Energy Will Decide the AI Race</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the race to dominate AI has so far focused on cutting-edge chips and capital expenditures, all the data centers in the world will not help you if they lack a continuous supply of affordable energy. While China clearly understands this, America may not, and that could create an opportunity for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Truth About Europe’s Regulation of Digital Platforms</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trumps-false-censorship-charge-and-how-eu-digital-regulation-really-works-by-bertrand-badre-et-al-2026-01</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump claims that Europeans are engaging in &quot;censorship&quot; when they require digital platforms to be transparent about their algorithms and to remove already illegal content. With the US recently barring entry to five Europeans it accuses of regulating online content, it is time to set the record straight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the United States and its allies finally led a push to end the Gaza war in 2025, it is not clear how regional stability will be restored, or what shape a new regional order will assume. For the foreseeable future, the Middle East will be bracing for a prolonged conflict as Israel pursues military supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Iran’s Protests Expose Deeper Fragility as Leaders Struggle to Contain Crisis</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/irans-protests-expose-deeper-fragility-as-leaders-struggle-to-contain-crisis</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/an-iranian-woman-stands-in-an-area-outside-a-holy-shrine-in-northern-tehran-iran-on-december-31-2025-following-the-latest-un.jpg?id=62651190&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C314%2C0%2C314&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CIPHER BRIEF EXPERT INTERVIEW&lt;/strong&gt; -- Economic grievances in Iran have sparked demonstrations for a fifth straight day, with protests surfacing in Tehran and multiple provincial cities as inflation, a collapsing currency, and worsening living conditions fuel public anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports from state-linked media, local officials, and rights groups confirm new clashes and at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/01/world/middleeast/iran-protests-deaths.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one additional death&lt;/a&gt;, though accounts differ over whether the deceased was a member of a pro-government militia or a protester. Several other incidents of violence were reported in western and southern regions, but independent verification remains difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Masoud Pezeshkian, traveling in southwestern and eastern Iran, has acknowledged mounting public dissatisfaction and urged officials to address the population’s concerns, calling mismanagement - not foreign adversaries - the primary cause of the crisis. His remarks contrasted with harder-line figures who continue to blame unnamed “enemies” for the unrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest protests began after the Iranian rial plunged to &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;record lows&lt;/a&gt;, prompting the resignation of Central Bank Governor Mohammad Reza Farzin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader economic backdrop is bleak: inflation remains above 40 percent, food and household costs have surged, and nearly every major sector outside oil is contracting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ongoing, still relatively small, economic protests now unfolding in several cities in Iran are the latest indicator of the Islamic Republic's fragility,” Middle East Expert and former National Security Manager for Iran at ODNI, Norm Roule tells &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roule explains in this exclusive Cipher Brief analysis, why he believes the latest protests are likely a sign of what could be waiting for Tehran in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;expert-block-container expert-list&quot;&gt;

          Norman Roule is a geopolitical and energy consultant who served for 34 years in the Central Intelligence Agency, managing numerous programs relating to Iran and the Middle East. He also served as the National Intelligence Manager for Iran (NIM-I)\n at ODNI, where he was responsible for all aspects of national intelligence policy related to Iran.
    	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANALYSIS -- “Since 2017, Tehran’s domestic oppression, persistent inflation, declining standards of living, international isolation, and weak domestic policy credibility have produced periods of sharp and widespread unrest. Iran’s security forces have responded brutally. But the protests have shattered the Islamic Republic’s political self-confidence. Tehran’s response to the ongoing demonstrations reflects that mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A regime that once boasted that its high national election turnout reflected the support of its people is now unable to hide historic low voter turnout and accepts the threat of destabilizing national unrest as an inevitable consequence of life in modern-day Iran. Economic challenges are not the regime’s only concern. Iran’s historic drought and other environmental problems persist. Winter saw a sharp decline in air quality in large areas of Tehran, Khuzestan, and Isfahan provinces. In early December, Iran’s health minister announced that ongoing air pollution problems had sent more than 170,000 Iranians to emergency wards with heart and respiratory problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the current unrest expands or dissipates - like prior waves of protest - remains uncertain. What is clearer is that the underlying drivers are durable, making future episodes virtually certain. The more consequential question is whether disillusionment will remain confined to civilians or will begin to test the cohesion and confidence of the security forces the Islamic Republic has relied upon for so many years to contain dissent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing collapse of Iran’s currency, the rial, ignited the protests this week. After the currency fell as low as 1.42 million per dollar, Central Bank Governor Mohammad Reza Farzin resigned. The magnitude of the slide is best understood with some history: In 1979, the Iranian rial stood at 72 to the dollar. On July 14, 2015, the day the Iran nuclear deal was signed in Vienna, the Iranian rial was at 29,500 per dollar. When Farzin entered office in December 2022, the rial traded at about 430,000 to the dollar. Whatever the precise benchmarks, the trend is unmistakable: the rial’s weakness has become both a symbol of policy failure and a driver of unrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The currency’s decline has coincided with bleak economic signals. Except for anemic growth in the oil sector, every key sector of Iran’s economy is entering recession, foreshadowing higher unemployment. Industry and mining declined by 3.4%, construction by 12.9% and agriculture contracted by 2.9%. At the same time, inflation is growing. The Statistical Center of Iran (SCI) reported that Iran’s average annual inflation reached 42.2% in December. A close examination of this number indicates the significant impact of inflation on Iranian consumers. Food, tobacco, and beverages rose 72% year over year. This persistent high inflation erodes the purchasing power of Iranians and drives an increasing number into poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tehran’s options are few. Iran’s problems are deep and structural, and durable improvement would require political and ideological shifts beyond what the Pezeshkian administration is likely able to deliver. Even so, the government will be compelled to act on three fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, Farzin’s resignation provides the president with a convenient focal point for public anger, but it does nothing to address the issues that precipitated the crisis: fiscal mismanagement, sanctions pressure, and chronic credibility deficits. President Pezeshkian has reportedly selected 64-year-old former economy minister Abdolnaser Hemmati as Farzin’s successor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemmati may at first seem a counterintuitive choice, given that the Iranian Parliament impeached him in March for failing in similar circumstances. However, he has a background that offers potential for stability. First, he is experienced. He led the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) from 2018 until late May 2021, during the Trump administration's earlier sanctions, and his work helped stabilize the foreign exchange market under similar difficult circumstances. He also qualifies as a regime insider with decades of experience with hardliners and more pragmatic conservatives. After beginning his career as an agricultural economist, he moved to Iran’s broadcasting organization, where he rose to become its political deputy and director general of news broadcasting. He then became the Director of Iran’s Central Insurance Corporation. Between 2006 and 2016, Hemmati led Sina Bank and Bank Mellat, banks with close ties to the Revolutionary Guard's Qods Force, to the extent that the U.S. and the European Union designated each. Hemmati attempted to enter the 2024 presidential election on a platform offering economic stabilization, but the Guardian Council rejected his candidacy. He instead became Pezeshkian’s economy minister, a position he held until his impeachment on 2 March 2024, following a spike in inflation and the rial's fall to 950,000 to the dollar. Ironically, that value would be seen as a significant improvement in its status today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemmati will need to work quickly with Pezeshkian to propose measures to decelerate inflation, with an emphasis on protecting low-income and rural households. In the medium term, Hemmati will need to target Iran’s banking sector to strengthen balance sheets and prevent further failures. The downside of this last step is that it will inevitably involve some recognition of bad loans and credit tightening to prevent additional poor loan issuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Pezeshkian will focus on budget reform. Details on his latest budget are limited, but we know that security and military entities remain well-resourced, which will constrain his options on the civilian side. He has proposed a 20% salary increase for public workers, but it will not keep up with inflation, and even here, he will struggle to find the funds. The budget debate will continue until 20 March 2026, and will likely remain contentious, given its emphasis on tax collection and subsidy cuts rather than oil revenues as a source of income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, foreign policy will remain the most complicated aspect of Pezeshkian’s economic challenges. His government will do whatever it can to mitigate the impact of sanctions through engagement with Russia, China, and Africa, and will continue to seek talks with Washington. Initiating negotiations with the U.S., even without a prospect of an outcome, has in the past strengthened the rial. But if Pezeshkian would welcome talks with the West, the hardline actors within the regime responsible for Iran’s foreign policy remain focused on aggressive goals that remain one of the primary obstacles to peace in the region. The Quds Force shows every sign of seeking to rebuild its shattered proxies and establish new relationships with the Khartoum and other actors in Africa. The Trump administration’s approach to Tehran has been consistent. It will not waste time on talks that offer sanctions relief without seismic changes in the regime’s approach to nuclear, missiles, and regional issues. Gulf Arabs are willing to maintain a strategy of détente but will not consider rapprochement without an end to Qods Force activity in the region. Absent political rapprochement and a belief that capital invested in Iran will not be subject to terrorism or human rights sanctions, foreign investment for Iran will remain impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, Iran’s leaders will inevitably recognize that this unrest is unfolding amid several hallmarks of a pre-revolutionary situation: institutional failure, fragmentation among the ruling elites, generational alienation, persistent fiscal crisis, widespread economic suffering, class antagonism, escalating and chronic protests, and the absence of a unifying state narrative. President Pezeshkian recently stated that his country was “in a full-fledged war with America, Israel, and Europe.” Such rhetoric will play to domestic hardline audiences while reinforcing Iran’s aggressive reputation abroad. During this sensitive period, Iran is unlikely to take actions that would further exacerbate its domestic fragility and instead seeks to gradually test Western red lines while navigating the Islamic Republic through what remains the regime's most sensitive and challenging economic and political period since the 1980s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube?

      <title>Putin Again Bungles Strategy: Why His War of Attrition will Sink Russia</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/putin-ukraine-war-sink-russia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;On February 14, 2022, with Russia poised to invade Ukraine, I questioned whether Vladimir Putin’s reign to that point had revealed him to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/is-the-russian-president-a-strategic-master-or-a-strategic-failure&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;strategic master or a strategic failure&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly four years later, the verdict is even more apparent. Putin, confident in his strategic calculus that the West would provide only token assistance to Ukraine, which would quickly fold under the weight and violence of Russian military might, fatefully launched his attack days later with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/putin-strategic-failure-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;disastrous consequences for Russia&lt;/a&gt;. The country he leads is now even poorer, more isolated, brittle, and dependent (on China) than before. Putin grossly underestimated Ukrainian will, overestimated the competence of his own military and intelligence apparatus, and misjudged Western cohesion. By the Fall of 2022, it was obvious even to Putin that his expected quick victory was unattainable. This was surely a bitter pill to swallow, but he quickly pivoted to a “wait and win” war strategy of grinding attrition, calculating that through sheer mass and perseverance--and Western impatience--time would be on his side. Most pundits, even those in the West, have tended to agree with him, much as they did in 2022 about the likelihood that Russia would quickly roll over Ukraine. This mindset, however--that time is on Russia’s side--risks a strategic misreading no less profound than his original blunder, because there is a strong argument to be made that Putin’s attrition strategy is eroding key foundations of Russian power faster and more deeply than it is eroding the Ukrainian front lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus far Russia has managed to sustain a high level of war spending, but there are growing signs of strain. Russia’s numerical troop advantage over Ukraine is maintained almost entirely through extraordinarily high financial incentives, but these are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euronews.com/2025/12/02/russia-cuts-troop-bonuses-and-delays-death-benefits-amid-budget-shortfalls&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;starting to drop steeply&lt;/a&gt; due to growing budget shortfalls, particularly in regional budgets on which such spending disproportionately falls. New contracts for soldiers in April-June 2025 were less than half the level of the same period in 2024, signaling a significant weakening in the effectiveness of financial inducements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just the money. The death toll for Russian soldiers is accelerating. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/07/secretary-of-state-marco-rubios-remarks-to-the-press-at-the-kuala-lumpur-convention-center&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stated in July of this year&lt;/a&gt; that the number of Russian dead for the first half of 2025 alone exceeded 100,000. This has likely contributed to a sharp increase in desertions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontelligence.substack.com/p/silent-exodus-rising-desertions-in&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;estimated to have doubled in 2025&lt;/a&gt; with approximately 70,000 desertions, or approximately 10% of the force in Ukraine. Russia is increasingly reliant on coerced recruits, harsh punishments for desertion, including torture and extrajudicial executions, all signs of a military struggling to maintain sustainable, motivated troop levels. While tactical adaptations have allowed Russian forces to regain some initiative on the battlefield, they rest on a manpower model that burns through human capital, i.e., human beings, at a pace no country with Russia’s demographic profile can long sustain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who’s Reading this? More than 500K of the most influential national security experts in the world. Need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;full access&lt;/a&gt; to what the Experts are reading?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the war drags on, Russia is also becoming even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/china-russia-relationship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more dependent on China&lt;/a&gt;. Post-2022 trade patterns show a Russia increasingly locked into an asymmetric partnership in which Russia humiliatingly relies on China for critical imports of technology, while Beijing gains leverage through discounted energy purchases and control over supply chains, making Moscow increasingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/china-is-russias-crutch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vulnerable to Beijing’s whims&lt;/a&gt; over time. For a leader obsessed with sovereignty, the long-term trajectory Putin has embarked on contains a glaring paradox: the longer he fights to keep Ukraine out of the Western orbit, the more he locks Russia into a subordinate position in China’s. Talk about strategic irony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These financial strains and deepening dependence on China are compounded by the continued tightening of international sanctions on the Russian energy sector, a general decrease in the price of oil and gas on which Russia is so heavily dependent as the global economy cools, and the heavy depletion of Russia’s “rainy day” sovereign wealth fund, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/russia-tomorrow/the-russian-economy-in-2025-between-stagnation-and-militarization/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;which has dropped by almost 60%&lt;/a&gt; and now mostly consists of Chinese Renminbi and gold, having exhausted its hard currency holdings. Maintaining current defense spending will thus increasingly require either higher borrowing from domestic banks or visible cuts in social spending and civilian projects, further eroding living standards and stoking popular war fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin’s war-of-choice with Ukraine has only intensified Russia’s pre-war weaknesses. Russia’s economy, already underperforming relative to its resource base and human potential, must now deal with permanent war spending and sanctions-induced inefficiencies. Its demographics, already fragile, are being further hollowed out by horrific war casualties and the emigration of skilled workers. Russia’s civic life, already stunted, is being further smothered by wartime repression. Finally, Putin’s invasion not only failed to restore a pliant Ukrainian “little brother”, it locked Russia into a costly struggle against the second largest country in Europe, after itself, and one that is moreover more anti-Russian, better armed, and more deeply integrated with the West than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

He underestimates the cumulative effect of casualties and consequences of economic distortions and social fatigue inside Russia; he overestimates the degree that support of the Western democracies for Ukraine will collapse under the weight of their debates and divisions; and he also, again, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/perhaps-ukraines-most-dangerous-time&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;overestimates&lt;/a&gt; his ability to break Ukraine by military force. In analyzing the arc of Putin’s rule, the war in Ukraine is not an aberration from Putinism, but its logical culmination. In strategic terms, it represents a transition from a condition of chronic underperformance to one of active and acute self-harm. Nearly four years after his decision to invade Ukraine, which more than anything else will define his reign, Putin is not outplaying history on a grand chessboard by doubling down on the war, he is sacrificing Russia’s future for the sake of victories and imperial fantasies that cannot be won, much less sustained. This is the definition of strategic failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a self-proclaimed student of Russian history, Putin would be wise to remember the setting of Russia’s original regime-toppling “color revolution,” the February Revolution of 1917. This was the spontaneous Russian popular uprising that led to the abdication of the Tsar and formation of a Provisional Government, not the subsequent Bolshevik coup d’etat later that year. While popular discontent with the monarchy had long been rising, it was the accumulated privations of war that brought events to a boiling point. As with that war, time in this one is not on Putin’s side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>Where Is the US Economy Headed in 2026?</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/where-is-the-us-economy-headed-in-2026</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a tumultuous 12 months for the US economy, the coming year may well be marked by even greater upheaval. From the likelihood that President Donald Trump’s tariff chickens will come home to roost to the risk of a stock-market crash, there is good reason to fear that the global economy’s most powerful engine may stall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite US President Donald Trump’s claims to the contrary, Europe’s problem is not too much integration but too little. To endure in a world increasingly dominated by continental powers, the European Union must complete its common institutions and forge a shared political identity capable of sustaining them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pope Leo XIV Has an Opportunity with the 2026 World Day of Peace</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/pope-leo-world-day-peace</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;On January 1, 2026, in his planned first message for the 59th World Day of Peace, Pope Leo XIV will reflect on peace, justice, and global harmony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 18, 2025, Pope Leo published his first major peace message themed “Peace be with you,” in preparation for his and the Catholic Church’s annual January 1st exhortation on World Peace. Pope Leo’s December message urged the faithful to not surrender to the idea that fear and darkness are normal, but to see peace as not only possible but necessary. “When we treat peace as a distant ideal, we cease to be scandalized when it is denied, or even when war is waged in its name… and to justify violence and armed struggle in the name of religion.” Pope Leo called on believers of all religions to guard against the temptation to weaponize words and religion to commit violence in its name. He ended with two searing eyewitness accounts of European horrors: the Bosnian war and the domestic terrorism that tormented Italy in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Day of Peace is an annual Catholic observance celebrated each January 1. Established in 1968 by Pope Paul VI, it is an opportunity for each pope to write a peace message and to reflect on peace, justice, and global harmony. The messages offer moral guidance to the Church and the world on how to pursue peace in a contemporary context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his first message for the 59th World of Peace, Pope Leo chose the theme “Peace be with you” as a call not only to desire peace, but to make it a lived reality. Indeed, peace is not just the absence of war, but rooted in justice, trust, dialogue, forgiveness, and shared humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Also, the possibility of direct U.S. military strikes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-caribbean-us-military-buildup&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Venezuela&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and of an increase in political violence and popular unrest in the United States are similarly worrying scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renewed armed conflict between Iran and Israel, artificial intelligence-enabled cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure and a cross-strait crisis between China and Taiwan are concerning. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/north-korea-nuclear-strategic-failure&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;North Korea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was elevated to a Tier 1 concern for 2026 – a top-priority global threat due to its nuclear weapons, ballistic missile programs and potential to destabilize Northeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The world continues to grow more violent and disorderly. Last year’s unprecedented level of anxiety among experts about the rising risk of conflict remains undiminished, according to the director of the CFR survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today. Gain access to save your virtual seat now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pope Leo, the first American pope, has an opportunity to put words into action, in the pursuit of peace. Since his election in May 2025, “peace be with you all” has been the foundation for his peace mission. In October 2025, at an interreligious meeting in Rome, Pope Leo declared: “Peace is holy, not war”, urging religious leaders to act as “mothers” who encourage people to treat each other as family. And in December 2025 during a trip to Lebanon he met with Muslim and Druze leaders, stating that authentic unity and friendship are the only ways to “put aside the arms of war.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pope Leo could and should convene a meeting of interreligious leaders to draft a strategy to bring peace to a troubled world. This, obviously, would be a monumental task, seemingly beyond the reach of any person, nation, alliance, and religion. But a leader that has the respect of peers and the public could be the catalyst for such a “peace movement.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pope Leo has my vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/dec/23/pope-leos-world-day-peace-opportunity-put-words-action/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/west-not-ready-multipolar-world-of-emerging-powers-china-india-brics-by-gemma-chenger-deng-and-jim-o-neill-2025-12</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is shifting from a largely hegemonic international system to a more fragmented, contested, and multipolar set of arrangements. In this environment, the central question for the West is not how to revive a dying order, but how to operate credibly and responsibly in one where influence must be shared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Climate Adaptation More Than Covers Its Cost</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/climate-adaptation-costs-and-benefits-for-2-degree-scenario-by-mekala-krishnan-et-al-2025-12</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Effective climate adaptation can strengthen countries’ resilience, protect vulnerable communities, and support economic growth. But while the world has the tools, the level of investment needed to close today’s adaptation gap, let alone to address likely future needs, has fallen far short.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Europe has become an unseemly hybrid: a punching bag and a laughingstock. But even if recent events make it difficult to feel optimistic, the continent's history offers plenty of reminders that reinvention and recovery are the rule, not the exception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By responding to economic insecurity with increasingly blunt tools like minimum-wage hikes, policymakers are overlooking the deeper problem: the accelerating decoupling of human labor time from economic value. The only solution is to recognize machine time as a distinct production input and price it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Donald Trump does not much care about building a better, fairer world, it might be possible to harness his self-interest to the cause of building one. His administration’s statements and policies point to several areas where the US just might be willing to support broadly beneficial transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The defining question of the 21st century is no longer whether humanity can build extraordinary systems, but whether we can align them – technically, institutionally, and morally – before they slip out of our control. Given recent trends in AI and climate governance, we have our work cut out for us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what far-right leaders claim, Europe’s greatest challenge is not immigration or “wokeness,” but its own economic and technological backwardness. With productivity growth lagging and innovation increasingly taking place elsewhere, Europe must confront its structural weaknesses or risk falling further behind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Bold 2025 National Security Strategy</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/national-security-strategy-indo-pacific</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;Out with a “rules-based international order” and in with “U.S. core national interests”, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. National Security Strategy (NSS) of 2025&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The NSS was not well-received by many of the 32 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Indeed, saying good-bye to the U.S. as the guarantor of global order will be difficult for many of our allies and partners, who will be expected to contribute more to their own defense and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe and the Middle East received lower priority in the NSS, with minimal criticism of Russia. The Western Hemisphere, however, is the primary security region for the U.S., under a modern “Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine”, with a focus on border control, mass migration, narco-trafficking and international crime and terrorism as principal threats to our nation’s security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NSS correctly in my view focused on the importance of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/north-korea-china-indo-pacific&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Indo-Pacific region&lt;/a&gt;. It called for expanding commercial and other relations with India to contribute to Indo-Pacific security. The NSS called on the Quad – Australia, Japan, India and the U.S., — to align its actions with allies and partners to prevent the domination by any single competitor nation. The NSS cited the need for the U.S. to invest in research to preserve and advance our advantage in cutting-edge military and dual-use technology, to include undersea, space, nuclear, AI, quantum computing and autonomous systems and the energy to fuel these domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NSS correctly focused on Taiwan and its dominance of semiconductor production and, also, Taiwan’s direct access to the Second Island Chain, splitting Northeast and Southeast Asia into two distinct theaters, and the one-third of global shipping that passes annually through the South China Sea and its implications for the U.S. economy. The NSS is clear in stating that deterring a conflict over Taiwan is a priority, making it clear that the U.S. does not support any unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NSS calls on our allies and partners to allow the U.S. military greater access to their ports and other facilities, to spend more on their own defense, and most importantly to invest in capabilities aimed at deterring aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan and South Korea are encouraged to increase defense spending, with new capabilities to deter adversaries and protect the First Island Chain. The NSS says the U.S. will harden and strengthen our military presence in the Western Pacific. Indeed, preventing conflict requires a vigilant posture in the Indo-Pacific, a renewed defense industrial base, greater military investment from us and from allies and partners, and winning the economic and technological competition over the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It’s never been more important to understand what’s happening in the world. Upgrade your access to exclusive content by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;becoming a subscriber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/trump-east-asia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Indo-Pacific&lt;/a&gt; is the source of almost half the world’s GDP and will grow over the century. It will be “among the next century’s key economic and geopolitical battlegrounds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom, as cited in the NSS, is that China &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/china-improve-us-relations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;duped us&lt;/a&gt; into believing that by opening our markets to China and encouraging American business to invest in China, starting in 1979 when China was a poor and backward nation, we would facilitate China’s entry into the so-called “rules-based international order.” And as the NSS mentions: “This did not happen. China got rich and powerful and used its wealth and power to its considerable advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there were leaders in China in the 1980s and 1990s who believed in democratization and the rule of law and open elections. Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang was removed from his leadership position because he, like his predecessor, Hu Yaobang, believed in democracy and the rule of law. Mr. Zhao was removed in June 1989 because he supported the student demonstrators at Tiananmen, and Mr. Hu was removed, also by Deng Xiaoping, for indulging in bourgeois liberalization and advocating democracy. A few years later, Premiers Wen Jiabao and Zhu Rongji, like Messrs. Hu and Zhao before them, were advocates for democratization and free and fair elections. Currently, there may be other senior officials in China who advocate for democratization and the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NSS is a powerful document, focusing on the Western Hemisphere and the security threat to the U.S. emanating from that region. And the U.S. focus on the Indo-Pacific region and deterring aggression in the First Island Chain while ensuring no unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait are clear and unambiguous goals of the Trump Administration. Getting the support of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/allies-in-a-dangerous-neighborhood-why-the-trump-lee-summit-matters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;regional allies and partners&lt;/a&gt; will be an important part of this national security strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/dec/17/bold-national-security-strategy/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <description>The challenge for India is no longer how to ensure Bangladesh’s stability, but how to engage a Bangladesh that is politically restless, socially mobilized, and strategically self-aware.</description>

      <title>The World Leaders to Watch in 2026</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/world-leaders-to-watch-2026</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;The recent release of President Trump’s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (NSS), with its emphasis on “the Trump corollary to the Monroe Doctrine,” and its resultant challenges, such as border security, migration, and narcotics trafficking, offer us an opportunity to closely examine leaders to watch in 2026. While previous similar columns in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts/kenneth-dekleva&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by this author had focused on adversaries such as Russia’s Putin, China’s Xi, North Korea’s Kim, and Iran’s Supreme Leader, today’s evolving geopolitical landscape (as described in the new NSS) suggests looking more closely at the motivations and leadership style of Venezuela’s adversary President Nicolas Maduro, Russia’s diplomatic emissary Kirill Dmitriev, and the deeply influential, newly elected Pope Leo XIV. And the gray zone is alive and well --- there are lots of ‘black swans’ flying around!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The influence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/xi-china-vatican-ai&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Pope Leo XIV&lt;/a&gt;, who has already shown himself to be a transformational Pope, is easily misunderstood. When Stalin famously quipped, “How many divisions does the Pope have,” today’s answer would be, 1.4 billion. Observers forget that the Vatican has one of the world’s oldest and formidable diplomatic and intelligence services. Several weeks ago, when Pope Leo visited the headquarters of the Italian Intelligence Service, he spoke eloquently, stating that intelligence professionals are entrusted with “the serious responsibility of constantly monitoring the dangers that may threaten the life of the Nation, in order above all to contribute to the protection of peace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pope Leo – whose first words to the flock upon his appointment to the Papacy were “Peace be with you,” has shown himself to be an adept diplomat. American-born, raised, and educated, he then spent several decades in Peru, as well as 20+ years in Rome. Fluent in English, Spanish, and Italian, he is a true citizen of, and Pope for, this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His initial diplomatic meetings and trips, as well as his daily commentaries on Instagram and Twitter, have showcased his nuance, spirituality, faith, and promotion of diplomacy and interfaith dialogue as solutions to the world’s conflicts. In his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/27/pope-leo-to-visit-turkey-and-lebanon-on-first-overseas-trip-as-pontiff&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first overseas trip&lt;/a&gt; to Turkey and Lebanon, he met with Turkey’s President Erdogan and emphasized Turkey’s role “as a bridge between East and West, Asia, and Europe.” The Pope’s statement highlights Turkey’s – and Erdogan’s – role (enhanced by his experienced Foreign Minister and former intelligence chief Hakan Fidan) as a potential mediator in conflicts such as Gaza and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pope Leo has also weighed in on the current conflict between the United States and Venezuela, stating that President Trump should avoid a military solution, and instead utilize diplomatic and even economic pressure to resolve the conflict. Such statements are crucial, as earlier in the year, Pope Leo had met with Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio (both are Catholic) shortly after his election. Given the Pope’s vast influence, President Trump and his national security team should thereby borrow a page from President Ronald Reagan’s 1980s playbook and forge a new ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/xi-china-vatican-ai&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Holy Alliance&lt;/a&gt;’ with Pope Leo and the Holy See, to seek peace in Ukraine, Venezuela, and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What national security news are you missing today?

Dmitriev, who is young and Ukrainian-born, spent nearly 20 years in the United States as a high school student and subsequent graduate of Stanford University and Harvard Business School. Later, he worked on Wall Street for Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, and Delta Capital, a U.S. government-funded investment fund, which later became the U.S.-Russia Business Fund. American businessmen whom I know who have worked with Dmitriev, describe him as brilliant, focused, and quite knowledgeable about the United States. In 2011, the latter entity became Russia’s Direct Investment Fund, which Dmitriev heads. It’s fair to say that this fund functions &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; as Putin’s ‘family office.’ This, along with Dmitriev’s closeness to Putin and his inner circle (Dmitriev’s wife and Putin’s daughter Katerina Tikhonova are close friends), along with his prolific use of social media (X), suggests a high level of trust, as Dmitriev has led delicate Ukraine peace negotiations with President Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Putin’s use of Dmitriev in his current diplomatic role may hint at Putin’s aspirations of a renewed, strategic, post-war relationship with Russia and the United States, one focusing on a variety of business deals. I’d argue that it goes further, and that Dmitriev is being groomed for more senior leadership roles in a post-Putin Russia. So, he is most definitely a figure to watch in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following America’s recent designation of Venezuela’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/11/terrorist-designations-of-cartel-de-los-soles&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cartel de los Soles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as a foreign terrorist organization (as was done earlier with respect to the Venezuelan transnational criminal organization, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/designation-of-international-cartels&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tren de Aragua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), President Trump has adopted a forceful approach towards Venezuela’s leader, President Nicolas Maduro. With the largest U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean since Panama (1989), as well as a covert action authorization, President Trump has also hinted at the possibility of a diplomatic resolution to the conflict between Venezuela and America; President Maduro has suggested diplomatic talks. This begs the question whether Maduro – the leader of Venezuela since 2013 - can be negotiated with. The answer to this question – yes, in my opinion – requires a keen understanding of Maduro’s leadership style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maduro’s history is well-known. As a high school graduate with socialist roots, he came up through party ranks early in his career, working first as a bus driver and unionist. Numerous media reports also note his close association with Cuba and his linkages to Cuban intelligence services. After the late Hugo Chavez’s failed 1992 military coup, Maduro became linked with Chavez, Venezuela’s President from 1998-2013, and was ‘anointed’ by the charismatic, populist Chavez as his successor, winning a narrowly contested election in 2013. Maduro has often been seen as lacking in personality, charisma, or gravitas, as compared to Chavez. And many have missed his ruthlessness, cleverness, cunning, resilience, and cruelty, as he became a dictator, overturning the results of last year’s 2024 election, won by Venezuela’s opposition, led by the courageous Nobel Laureate – known as Venezuela’s ‘Iron Lady’ – Maria Corina Machado. And his incompetent socialist economic and political policies led Venezuela – once the thriving gem of Latin America, with its democratic spirit, oil riches, natural resources, and a thriving middle class - to economic ruin, penury, and a brain drain of over eight million Venezuelans. Maduro now leads a vast ‘narco state’ and criminal enterprise, funded by drugs, rare earths, minerals, gold, and oil, and beholden to criminal elements in the military, intelligence services, and transnational criminal networks, as well as his close ties to America’s adversaries such as Iran, Cuba, Russia, and China. Maduro’s criminality – America has even put a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/nicolas-maduro-moros&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$50 million bounty&lt;/a&gt; on him - is what now keeps him in power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today. Gain access to save your virtual seat now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maduro’s negotiation skills merit attention. Earlier this year, he showcased his negotiating prowess in releasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/31/venezuela-frees-americans-trump-envoy-00201924&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;six American hostages&lt;/a&gt; after meeting with Trump’s special envoy Richard Grenell. Maduro has even written a recent letter to Pope Leo IV (who has called for dialogue and peace in Venezuela), stating, “I have great faith that Pope Leo, as I stated in the letter I sent him, will help Venezuela preserve and achieve peace and stability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump has often shown a combination of negotiating flexibility with ‘Reaganesque’ strategic deterrence. Maduro must also be given an absolute deadline to shut down the Iranian drone base and to insist that all Iranian, Cuban, and Russian military and intelligence ‘advisors’ leave Venezuela within 24 hours --- or else! President Trump’s vast military buildup, military strikes on drug boats, seizure of Venezuela’s ‘shadow’ fleet of oil tankers, and designation of Venezuelan criminal organizations as foreign terrorist entities have boxed Maduro into a very tight corner. And America’s bold ‘exfiltration’ of Venezuela’s brave, courageous opposition leader and Nobel Laureate Maria Corina Machado sent a powerful, symbolic message to Maduro: we can get her out, and we can bring her back in, at will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump, as a former real estate CEO, can appreciate that regime change bears similarity to evicting a difficult tenant. Often, they must be bought out. Fortunately, there is ample precedent in American diplomacy in this regard. In 1991, America, working closely with the late Israeli diplomat Uri Lubrani and Ethiopia’s late Kassa Kebede (a former foreign minister and Ambassador to the UN/Geneva), paid $35 million ($83 million in 2025 dollars) – which was never fully accounted for! - to Ethiopia to allow 15,000 Beta Israel refugees to depart Ethiopia for Israel, and Ethiopia’s dictator Haile Mengistu to go into exile. Similar considerations might be considered with respect to Maduro, especially when America has spent over $1 billion USD in its current military buildup in the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as 2026 approaches, all eyes are on President Trump. It’s his move. Given his and America’s prestige on the line, there is no margin for error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump's second administration has stood out for its unconstrained assertion of executive primacy and a foreign policy that has shifted geopolitical power in favor of Russia and China.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the global retreat from multilateralism, international efforts to protect the ocean gained momentum in 2025, leading to some landmark decisions. To build on this progress, policymakers must fully implement these new agreements and treaties, and all stakeholders must quickly mobilize more finance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Donald Trump followed through on his campaign promise to raise tariffs sharply in 2025, the domestic economic impact was not as bad as many had feared. But there is good reason to think that the tariffs' adverse impact on inflation and employment was merely delayed – and could materialize with full force in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although diplomacy has long been at the forefront of Sino-American engagement, the rise of politically constrained, egocentric leaders, coupled with new strains of nationalism in the United States and China, has rendered it ineffective.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;European voters increasingly resemble their Argentinian counterparts, who, until recently, believed the unsustainable promises offered by Peronist politicians. To avoid the economic shock therapy that has befallen Argentina, Europe’s leaders must be willing to make hard choices, and electorates must be willing to reward them for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fueled by anger over corruption, high living costs, and narrowing opportunities, youth-led protests have been sweeping the developing world. Rather than seeking to upend political systems, activists are calling for governments that deliver economic security, accountability, and climate action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Modeling the Earth with AI is Now a Strategic Intelligence Imperative</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/artificial-intelligence-modeling-earth-geoint</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT OPINION / PERSPECTIVE&lt;/strong&gt; — We are currently witnessing a mobilization of technical ambition reminiscent of the Manhattan Project, a realization that data and compute are the new defining elements of national power. I am deeply energized by recent bold moves in Washington, specifically the White House’s launch of the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://genesis.energy.gov/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Genesis Mission&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot; this past November—an initiative designed to federate vast federal scientific datasets for integrated AI training—alongside the real-world deployment of &lt;a href=&quot;http://genai.mil/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;GenAI.mil&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, when I look at the velocity of the commercial sector—from OpenAI launching its dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/science/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Science division&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and NVIDIA attempting to simulate the planet with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/high-performance-computing/earth-2/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Earth-2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to Google DeepMind aggressively crossing their AI breakthroughs into the geospatial domain—it becomes clear that we are still aiming too low. These projects are not just modeling data; they are attempting to model reality itself. American technical leadership is paramount, but that leadership is meaningless if it is not ruthlessly and immediately applied to our national security framework. We must take these massive, reality-simulating concepts and focus them specifically on the GEOINT mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A perfect example of this is that earlier this year, in July 2025, the geospatial world shifted. Google DeepMind released the &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.google/blog/alphaearth-foundations-helps-map-our-planet-in-unprecedented-detail/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;AlphaEarth Foundations (AEF) model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and through the hard work of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tgengine.org/building-frictionless-geospatial-ai-making-alphaearth-foundations-embeddings-accessible/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Taylor Geospatial Engine (TGE) and the open-source community&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, those vector embeddings are now publicly available on Source

/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The excitement is justified. AlphaEarth is a leap forward because it offers pixel-level embeddings rather than the standard patch-level approach. It doesn’t just tell you “this 256x256 square contains a city”; it tells you &quot;this specific pixel is part of a building, and it knows its neighbors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as I look at this achievement from the perspective of national security, I see something else. I see a proof of concept for a capability that the United States is uniquely positioned to build—and &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; build—to maintain decision advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has the internet’s data. But the intelligence community holds the most diverse, multi-physics, and temporally deep repository of the Earth in human history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is time for the United States to propose and execute a National Geospatial-Intelligence Embedding Model (NGEM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

In the national security domain, an optical image is just the tip of the spear. We don't just see with light; we see with physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am proposing that we train a massive, pixel-level foundation model that ingests all of its holdings. We aren't talking about just throwing more Sentinel-2 data at a GPU. We are talking about a model that generates embeddings from a unified ingest of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multi-INT Imagery: Electro-optical (EO), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Infrared/Thermal, Multispectral, and Hyperspectral.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vector Data: The massive stores of Foundation GEOINT (FG)—roads, borders, elevation meshes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Critical Missing Modality: Text. We must embed the millions of intelligence reports, analyst notes, and finished intelligence products ever written.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Approach: &quot;The Unified Latent Space&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach would mirror the AlphaEarth architecture—generating 64-dimensional (or higher) vectors for every coordinate on Earth—but with a massive increase in complexity and utility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In AlphaEarth, a pixel’s embedding vector encodes &quot;visual similarity.&quot; In an NGA NGEM, the embedding would encode phenomenological and semantic truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would train the model to map different modalities into the same &quot;latent space.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a SAR image shows a T-72 tank (through radar returns), and an EO image shows a T-72 tank (through visual pixels), and a text report describes a &quot;T-72 tank,&quot; they should all map to nearly the same mathematical vector.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The model becomes the universal translator. It doesn't matter if the input is a paragraph of text or a thermal signature; the output is a standardized mathematical representation of the object.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Outcomes: What Does This Give Us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we achieve this, we move beyond &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/leveraging-ai-in-no-fail-mission-for-u-s-intelligence&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;computer vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot; into &quot;machine understanding.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. The &quot;SAM Site&quot; Dimension In the AlphaEarth analysis, researchers found a &quot;dimension 27&quot; that accidentally specialized in detecting airports. It was a serendipitous discovery of the model's internal logic. If we train NSEM on NGA’s holdings, we won’t just find an airport dimension. We will likely find dimensions that correspond to specific &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/expert-qa-the-ai-challenge-for-the-u-s-military&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;national security targets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dimension 14 might light up only for Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) sites, regardless of whether they are camouflaged in optical imagery, because the thermal and SAR layers give them away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dimension 42 might track &quot;maritime logistics activity,&quot; integrating port vectors with ship signatures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Cross-Modal Search (Text-to-Pixel) Currently, if an analyst wants to find &quot;all airfields with extended runways in the Pacific,&quot; they have to rely on tagged metadata or run a specific computer vision classifier. With a multi-modal embedding model, the analyst could simply type a query from a report: &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Suspected construction of hardened aircraft shelters near distinct ridge line.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Because we embedded the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of millions of past reports alongside the imagery, the model understands the semantic vector of that phrase. It can then scan the entire globe’s pixel embeddings to find the mathematical match—instantly highlighting the location, even if no human has ever tagged it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Vector-Based Change Detection AlphaEarth showed us that subtracting vectors from 2018 and 2024 reveals construction. For the intelligence community, this becomes Automated Indications &amp; Warning (I&amp;amp;W). Because the embeddings are spatially aware and pixel-dense, we can detect subtle shifts in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of a facility, not just its footprint.

      <title>Why the ‘Double Tap’ Incident Matters Far Beyond a Single Strike</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/caribbean-double-tap-counternarcotics-strike</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;For about a week we experienced significant controversy over the first military attack on alleged narco-trafficker small boats off the coast of Venezuela (and later Ecuador). The controversy began with&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/z2C8K2M3ydkTdXwe5&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;news that the Secretary of Defense had ordered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the Special Operations Command Task Force commander to, “Kill them all.” This was linked to reports that the boat was attacked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-caribbean-second-strike&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;not once, but twice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/QLjEgN3SgmPOMKPoc&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;the second attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; launched with full knowledge that two survivors from the first attack were hanging on the capsized remnants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critical commentary exploded, much of it based on the assumption that the “kill them all” order had been issued, and that it was issued after the first strike. Even after the&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/jn7tLpsKRiOJxuZ87&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Admiral who ordered the attacks &lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/jn7tLpsKRiOJxuZ87&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refuted that allegation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, critics continued to assert that the attack was, ‘clearly’ a war crime as it was obviously intended to kill the two survivors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public still does not know all the details about these attacks. What is known, however, is that&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/QLci46pBN9yyUFgsA&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Congress held several closed-door hearings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that included viewing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/transparency-strikes-drug-boats&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;video feed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the attacks and testimony from the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Admiral who commanded the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, the reaction to these hearings has&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/PAOZKv9GxVjZe0CQP&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;crystalized along partisan lines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Democratic Members of Congress and Senators have insisted they observed a war crime and called for public release of the video. Republicans, in contrast, have indicated they are satisfied that the campaign is&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/OiyjQEH4Imf0uQGmI&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;based on a solid legal foundation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that nothing about the attacks crossed the line into illegality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is less obvious than the partisan reaction is how what began as a problem for the administration has ended up becoming a windfall. When Senator Roger Wicker, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee,&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/1SZUGyvAxrP5vQ0Tm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after the second closed door briefing that he was satisfied with the administration’s legal theory and saw no evidence of a war crime, it provided a signal to the administration that this Congress is not going to interfere with its military campaign. Democrats will try: they will continue to&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/a7GN2ELILqM4A4emn&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;demand hearings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they have asserted violation of the&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/Xind06zolAt3ZzNH2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;War Powers Act&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/jJFKddpmmDsuf1Jby&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;propose legislation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; requiring immediate termination of the campaign, and they will continue to insist the U.S. military has been ordered to conduct&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/t4qGX9ncDNHlUizSO&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;illegal killings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But so long as the Republican majority is tolerant of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/war-powers-caribbean-counternarcotics&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;presidential assertion of war power&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there is virtually nothing to check it. This so-called ‘double tap’ tested the political waters, and it turns out they are quite favorable for the President.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What national security news are you missing today?

For example, characterizing the second attack as a war crime – or rejecting that conclusion – implicitly endorses the administration’s theory that it is engaged in an armed conflict against Tren de Aragua, an interpretation of international law that has been&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justsecurity.org/120753/collection-u-s-lethal-strikes-on-suspected-drug-traffickers/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;rejected by almost all legal experts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Equally overbroad has been the assumption that the second attack must have been intended to kill the survivors from the first attack – an assumption that renders that attack nearly impossible to justify, even assuming it was conducted pursuant to a valid invocation of wartime legal authority. But even release of the video would be insufficient to answer a critical question in relation to this assumption: was the second attack directed against the survivors, or against the remnants of the boat with knowledge it would likely kill the survivors as a collateral consequence? Only the Admiral and those who advised him can answer that question. And if the answer is, ‘the remnants, not the survivors’, other difficult questions must be addressed: what was the military necessity for ‘finishing off’ the boat? And, most importantly, why wasn’t it operationally feasible to do something – perhaps just dropping a raft into the water – to spare the survivors that lethal collateral effect?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the true significance of this incident and the reaction it triggered extends far beyond the question of whether that second attack was or was not lawful; it is the implicit validation of the foundation for the legal architecture the administration seems to be erecting to justify expanding the conflict to achieve regime change in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/caribbean-venezuela-maduro-counternarcotics&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Venezuela&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In this regard, it is important to recognize that the Trump Administration is implicitly acknowledging it must situate its campaign and any extension of this campaign within the boundaries of international law, even as it seeks to expand them&lt;a href=&quot;https://warontherocks.com/2025/12/attacking-drug-boats-bending-or-breaking-the-law/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;beyond their rational limits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Understanding this consequence begins with two essential considerations. First, the Trump Administration’s consistent invocation of international legal authority for its counter-drug campaign - albeit widely condemned as invalid – indicates that any expansion of this campaign will be premised on a theory of international legality. Second, that theory will have to align with the very limited authority of a state to use military force against another state enshrined in the&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/quD6HT5x4mLb526WW&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Charter of the United Nations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That limited authority begins with Article 2(4) of the Charter, which&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/evDcR6XGQiRNFQEh6&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;prohibits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a state’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any other United Nations member state. This prohibition is not, however, conclusive. Instead, the Charter recognizes two exceptions allowing for the use of force. First, military action authorized by the Security Council as a measure in response to an act of aggression, breach of the peace, or threat to international peace and security. Such authorizations have been used since creation of the U.N., one example being the&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/XRfGETVymmyejslVG&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;use of force authorization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; adopted in 2014 to establish humanitarian safe areas in Libya; the authorization that led to the Libyan air campaign. The reason such authorizations have been infrequent is because any one of the five permanent members of the Security Council (the United States, United Kingdom, France, China, and Russia) may veto any resolution providing for such authorization for any reason whatsoever. It is inconceivable the U.S. could garner support for such authorization to take military action in and/or against Venezuela, much less even seek such an authorization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second exception to the presumptive prohibition on the threat or use of force is the&lt;a href=&quot;https://lieber.westpoint.edu/interpreting-law-self-defense/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;inherent right of individual and collective self-defense&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enshrined in Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. That right arises when a state is the victim of an actual or imminent armed attack. Furthermore, the understanding of that right has evolved in the view of many states – and certainly the United States – to apply to threats posed by both states and non-state organized armed groups like al Qaeda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today. Gain access to save your virtual seat now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the inception of this counter-narcotics campaign the Trump administration has asserted that the smuggling of illegal – and all too often deadly – narcotics into the United States amounts to an ‘armed attack’ on the nation. This characterization – coupled with the more recent&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/k2E6oOweg5P3s0tk9&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;designation of fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – is obviously intended to justify an invocation of Article 51 right of self-defense. As with the assertion that TdA is engaged in an armed conflict with the United States, this invocation has been almost universally condemned as invalid. But that seems to have had little impact on Senators like Wicker or&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/49NuvzdPVEaE4uUeW&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Graham&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and other Republicans who have indicated they are satisfied that the campaign is on solid legal ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, of course, the campaign based on this assertion of self-defense has been limited to action in international waters. But President Trump indicated in his last cabinet meeting that&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/g0JtiMHiA863IPCbQ&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;he intends to go after ‘them’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the land – ostensibly referring to members of TdA. So, how would an assertion of self-defense justify extending attacks &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;into &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Venezuelan territory, and what are the broader implications for potential conflict escalation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer to that question implicates a doctrine of self-defense long embraced by the United States: &lt;a href=&quot;https://share.google/3kB7ZegSZxcniZ0d5&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;‘unable or unwilling.’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pursuant to this interpretation of the right of self-defense, a nation is legally justified in using force in the territory of another state to defend itself against a non-state organized armed group operating out of that territory when the territorial state is ‘unable or unwilling’ to prevent those operations. It is, in essence, a theory of self-help based on the failure of the territorial state to fulfill its international legal obligation to prevent the use of its territory by such a group. And there have been numerous examples of U.S. military operations justified by this theory. Perhaps the most obvious was the operation inside Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden. Many other drone attacks against al Qaeda targets in places like Yemen and Somalia are also examples. And almost all operations inside Syria prior to the fall of the Asad regime were based on this theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By implicitly endorsing the administration’s theory that the United States is acting against TdA pursuant to the international legal justification of self-defense, Republican legislators have opened the door to expanding attacks into Venezuelan territory. It is now predictable that the administration will invoke the unwilling or unable doctrine to justify attacks on alleged TdA base camps and operations in that country. But, unlike other invocations of that theory, it is equally predictable that the territorial state – Venezuela, will reject the U.S. legal justification for such action. This means Venezuela will treat any incursion into its territory as an act of aggression in violation of Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, triggering &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;its &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;right of self-defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, such a dispute over which state is and which state is not validly asserting the right of self-defense would be submitted to and resolved by the Security Council. But it is simply unrealistic to expect any Security Council action if U.S. attacks against TdA targets in Venezuela escalate to direct confrontation between Venezuela and the U.S. Instead, each side will argue it is acting with legal justification against the other side’s violation of international law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this means in more pragmatic terms is that there is a real likelihood a U.S. invocation of the unable or unwilling doctrine could quickly escalate into direct hostilities with the Venezuelan armed forces. At that point, we should expect the administration will treat any effort by Venezuela to interfere with our ‘self-defense’ operations as a distinct act of aggression, thereby justifying action to neuter Venezuela’s military capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, impossible to predict exactly what the administration is planning &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;vis a vis &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Venezuela. Perhaps this is all part of a pressure campaign intended to avert direct confrontation by persuading Maduro’s power base to abandon him. But the history of such tactics does not seem to support the expectation Maduro will depart peacefully, or that any resulting regime change will have the impact the Trump Administration might desire. One need only consider how dictators like Saddam Hussein and Manuel Noriega resisted such pressures and clung to power even when U.S. military action that they had no chance of withstanding became inevitable. Or perhaps the administration will bypass the ‘unable and unwilling’ approach and simply initiate direct action against Venezuela to topple Maduro based on an even more dubious claim of self-defense now that he has been designated part of another foreign terrorist organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing, however, is certain: the options for extending this military campaign to Venezuela are built upon the feeble foundation that the U.S. is legitimately exercising the right of self-defense against TdA. And now, because of an attack that triggered congressional scrutiny, the administration is in a stronger position politically than ever thanks to Republican legislators endorsing this theory of international legality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real issue that was at stake during those closed door hearings was never really whether a possible war crime occurred, although the deaths that have resulted from the ‘second strike’ (like all the deaths resulting from this campaign) are highly problematic. The real issue was and remains the inherent invalidity of a U.S. assertion of wartime legal authority and a congressional majority that seems all too willing acquiesce to an administration that seems willing to bend law to the point of breaking to advance its policy agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicolas Maduro is a tyrant who has illegitimately clung to power contrary to the popular will of the Venezuelan people. His nefarious activities and anti-democratic rule justify U.S. efforts to force him out of power and enable restoration of genuine democracy in that country. What it does not justify is constructing a legal edifice built on an invalid foundation to justify going to war against Venezuela to achieve that goal. But now that the Trump administration has tested the political waters, that seems more likely than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>The Push and Pull Between Washington and Beijing in the South China Sea</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/south-china-sea-push-pull</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;China uses a layered approach in the South China Sea that blends military power, paramilitary forces, legal instruments, and political signaling. Beijing has&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/china-news-argues-history-supports-territorial-claims-south-china-sea-2032434&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;asserted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “historic rights” over most of the waterway in the past two decades or so, via the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3275865/what-beijings-9-dash-line-south-china-sea-and-what-does-it-mean&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;nine-dash line strategy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This strategy overlaps the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of several Southeast Asian states. A 2016 international law tribunal convened under UNCLOS&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/world/asia/south-china-sea-hague-ruling-philippines.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;ruled overwhelmingly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against these claims. However, China rejected the ruling and continues to behave as before, trying to assert de facto control in the area. This strategy is reinforced by the use of 'official maps', textbooks, and diplomatic statements aiming to slowly set down the notion that the territorial waters there are under a Chinese sphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Spratly and Paracel Islands, China has&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/satellite-photos-artificial-island-mischief-reef-south-china-sea-2120562&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;transformed reefs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; since the early to mid 2010s into large artificial islands, where it constructs airfields, ports, radars, and missile sites, dramatically expanding China’s ability to monitor and, if necessary, contest and harass surface and air traffic across much of the South China Sea. They also serve as logistics hubs that support the constant presence of Coast Guard, navy, and militia vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is testing just how much military risk the United States is willing to face in order to protect its regional allies. Their primary target? The Philippines, an avid American ally in the region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chinese coercion directed at Manila is carried out daily not just by destroyers but by white-hulled&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gmfus.org/news/bonnie-glasers-testimony-chinese-maritime-coercion-east-asia-what-tools-can-be-used-respond&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Coast Guard ships&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and ostensibly civilian vessels organized as a maritime militia. These platforms ram, water-cannon, block, or sideswipe Philippine vessels and increasingly use tools like signal jamming and close-in maneuvers against&lt;a href=&quot;https://amti.csis.org/shifting-tactics-at-second-thomas-shoal/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Philippine resupply missions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Second Thomas Shoal and patrols near Scarborough Shoal. Actions are calibrated to be intimidating, sometimes injurious, but still below the threshold of what most governments would label “armed attack.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These efforts go beyond short-term tactics. They are strategic in nature. China appears less focused on legal recognition than on practical control. If foreign militaries and commercial operators must factor in Chinese reactions for transiting, fishing, or exploration, Beijing achieves much of what formal sovereignty would deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Beijing, the South China Sea is part of the “near seas” in Chinese&lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&amp;amp;context=cmsi-maritime-reports&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;maritime doctrine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making it a defensive bastion that must be secured. But by employing artificial island bases and sending out to sea a number of maritime patrols, China seeks to disrupt American and allied activities in the South China Sea while advancing its own power projection further east and south, into the Pacific and Indian Oceans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What national security news are you missing today?

By standing firm in the South China Sea, it bolsters PRC leadership legitimacy and makes compromise politically costly internally. Essentially, Xi Jinping appears to be aiming for a Sino-centric maritime order in which neighboring states de facto - if not de jure at some point - accept Chinese rule as a fact of life and where outside powers operate only on terms that Beijing deems acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://2017-2021.state.gov/u-s-position-on-maritime-claims-in-the-south-china-sea/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;declared aims&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the South China Sea are the preservation of the freedom of navigation and overflight according to international law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve these goals the United States uses a combination of naval power, alliance creation and military capability development. The United States Navy ships often&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinaseausa-exclusive-idUSKCN12L1O9/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;come close&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Chinese-held land and other maritime areas that China or others claim illegally. It does the latter to demonstrate that America will not tolerate any of these claims. These are high-profile but relatively short-lived operations. The above policy is enforced by the U.S. 7th Fleet (based in Japan). There are also more&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-reveals-locations-4-new-strategic-sites-us-military-pact-2023-04-03/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;bases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; throughout the region in partnership with the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big, complicated&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.usni.org/2023/08/27/u-s-australia-japan-drill-with-the-philippines-in-south-china-sea-china-flies-military-drone-near-taiwan&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;exercises&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and joint patrols with the Philippines, Japan, Australia and others build interoperability as well as signal that any serious conflict would not take place strictly on a bilateral basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American officials who point out to the 2016 decision, stress that disagreements must be settled in compliance with international law and publicly reiterate that the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.war.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3383607/fact-sheet-us-philippines-bilateral-defense-guidelines/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;United States - Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pertains to American armed forces, public ships or aircraft coming under attack in the South China Sea.

Instead of sending out stand-alone destroyer transits, the U.S. ought to incorporate freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) as part of logistics missions or surveillance patrols and multilateral exercises. Publicly, Washington should continue to declare that significant attacks on Philippine government ships and aircraft comes under the Mutual Defense Treaty. The U.S. should reiterate privately to Chinese officials what responses it may evoke from the United States - economic sanctions, change in military posture, joint deployments - so that Chinese leaders know where they are headed if they keep these tactics up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to donating patrol boats, the United States and allies should also assist the Philippines and potentially other claimant states in fielding new coastal defense missiles, unmanned systems and integrated maritime domain awareness networks. Such instruments make it easier for frontline states to detect and respond to incursions with both greater speed and credibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China likes to&lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/19/business/china-negotiating-power-us-trade-talks&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;negotiate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; one on one — and that’s when it has its own leverage. The United States needs to cultivate overlapping coalitions rather than a simple hub-and-spoke model. Institutionalize 'mini-lateral' groupings; U.S. - Japan - Philippines and U.S. - Australia - Philippines patrols, exercises, and intelligence-sharing agreements would make it more difficult for China to pressure any one state without having to face several others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communication links with Beijing such as political and operational hotlines should be tested to ensure they will work under stress. The aim is to be predictable and resolute, to minimize the chances that miscalculation leads to uncontrolled escalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South China Sea has turned into a laboratory for the interaction among power, law and norms in an age of strategic contention. China’s use of maritime power looks to transform disputed waters into a zone over which China can make effective, if not&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgoldenziel/2025/12/02/chinas-lawfare-is-reshaping-sovereignty-and-supply-chain-security/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;legally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exclusive, rules and enforce them through militarized outposts, continuous presence, and the narrative fiction of historical rights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. policy has preserved core principles - freedom of navigation and treaty commitments - but has not prevented Beijing from strengthening its position or normalizing gray-zone coercion. Washington’s task is not to contain China in absolutist terms, but to ensure that&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/north-east-asia/taiwan-strait-china/333-preventing-war-taiwan-strait&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;coercive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; changes to the status quo do not become the region’s operating default. That requires more concrete deterrence at key flashpoints, deeper empowerment of frontline states, and a denser web of regional cooperation - combined with realistic crisis planning to manage the risks that come with sustained great-power competition at sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>This is Perhaps Ukraine’s Most Dangerous Time</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/perhaps-ukraines-most-dangerous-time</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT PERSPECTIVE —&lt;/strong&gt; Each of my eight trips to Ukraine since retiring from the CIA in the summer of 2023 has been filled with unique challenges. Each time I’ve witnessed first-hand the sacrifices the Ukrainians are making on a daily basis to fight for their country’s independence. And while each trip has been physically exhausting, each one has also been highly inspiring because the Ukrainians are fighting to protect many of the traditional American values that I grew up believing in, including the right to self-determination, liberty and national sovereignty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But my latest visit to Ukraine was by far the most difficult. Not just because the Russians are significantly increasing their air attacks on Ukrainian towns and cities or because Ukraine is once again going through a very cold winter while facing significant power shortages caused by Moscow’s attacks against energy infrastructure targets. But mainly because for the first time, I heard Ukrainians questioning my country’s commitment to helping them defend their country. Because I heard Ukrainian interlocutors conclude that the U.S. was not a reliable partner and because Ukrainians who are fighting to protect their country, questioned whether the U.S. was willing to abandon support for their cause in order to secure potential business deals with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and his regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remembering all the Americans I had served with over the years, especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice defending liberty and the honor of our country, it is extremely painful to consider the possibility that my country might choose to placate someone like Putin and, in doing so, turn its back on those who have suffered from Putin’s aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After more than 10 years of being at war, the Ukrainians are clearly fatigued. Russia's constant attacks against civilian targets are taking a toll. Families throughout the country are living without regular access to electricity and are subjected to daily mass Russian drone and missile attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine's own internal corruption challenges, including the &quot;Operation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/world/europe/zelensky-yermak-resigns-ukraine-corruption-scandal.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt;&quot; investigation, which resulted in the resignation of President Zelensky’s longtime advisor and head of the Presidential Office, Andriy Yermak, have raised questions among many Ukrainians about Zelensky and his Administration. The scandal also opened the door for many of the opponents of continued support to Ukraine to claim that Ukraine is a corrupt country led by corrupt leaders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, these critics forget that the Midas investigation is actually evidence of Ukraine’s efforts to deal with corruption and a development that highlights Kyiv’s determination to create a more transparent government based on “rule of law” principles. And there is no comparison between Ukraine’s efforts to deal with corruption, and Russia’s lack of transparency and complete rejection of “rule of law” governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian fears about being abandoned by Washington are linked to the perception that the U.S. is going to end its support for Kyiv. Fears that are amplified by the recent leaking of the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-peace-deal&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;28 Point Plan&lt;/a&gt;&quot; that was initially presented to Kyiv by the U.S. as part of Washington’s efforts to bring the war to an end and revelations that the bulk of the plan was written by the Kremlin and then delivered to the U.S. Special Envoy for the Middle East and Russia Steve Witkoff by Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund head Kiril Dmitriyev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These leaks bore many of the hallmarks of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-narratives-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Russian disinformation campaign&lt;/a&gt;, and whether or not the Kremlin leaked this information, there is little doubt that Moscow is using the leaks to undermine the U.S. internationally; to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its allies in Europe; to undermine the morale of the Ukrainian population; and to deceive international and domestic audiences into believing Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to find a peaceful resolution to the war that he started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow has worked relentlessly to create the impression in Washington, Brussels and Kyiv - that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are on the verge of collapse, and it is only a matter of time before Putin achieves his military objectives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainians, on the other hand, are trying to counter this narrative and demonstrate that the Russians continue to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/12/12/russia-s-phantom-advances-in-ukraine_6748441_4.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;minimal battlefield gains&lt;/a&gt; while paying a tremendous price in terms of personnel and resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While people are tired, few appear ready to surrender or give up. Many equate surrender to betrayal of the memories of those Ukrainians who have died since 2014 fighting to defend the country from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin’s effort to control the narrative on Ukraine is partially linked to his desire to cover up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/putin-strategic-failure-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;how bad his own hand is&lt;/a&gt; at present. Putin does not want the West to focus on how the Russian military continues to struggle to take small amounts of territory, while suffering high casualty rates. He does not want others to focus on Russia’s own struggles with growing financial, economic and social problems that threaten the long-term stability of his regime and the future of Russia itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the Kremlin has shifted its limited financial resources to the Military-Industrial complex, resulting in cutbacks to social spending and bringing an end to support of critical civilian infrastructure projects. While this policy has resulted in an increase in defense production, it is bankrupting the country and in recent months even Russia’s defense industry has had to implement spending cutbacks. Many factories and production sites across Russia are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-industrial-titans-furlough-workers-its-war-economy-stalls-2025-10-09/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unable to pay workers&lt;/a&gt; and have been forced to reduce their work week to three or four days per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The money that Putin was once able to use to incentivize Russians to join the military and fight Ukraine is drying up, forcing him to once again consider mobilization plans, which will no doubt be highly unpopular with many Russians, especially with the “elites” living in the country’s main population centers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The war has also drained off workers, resulting in significant labor shortages. Putin’s war is threatening to plunge Russia into the chaotic and painful social and economic conditions that the country faced in the early and mid-1990s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before leaving on my latest trip to Ukraine, I was asked to speak at an event in Washington D.C. focused on the future of U.S.-European relations. During that event, one attendee told me that recent polling in the U.S. showed that - since President Trump’s January 2025 inauguration - support for Ukraine among Republicans had risen significantly. This claim was supported by a report published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2025/12/majority-americans-favor-more-support-ukraine-ukrainian-victory/409925/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defense One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; based on polling conducted by the Ronald Reagan Institute and a previous report published by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/dramatic-rise-republican-support-ukraine&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chicago Institute on Global Affairs&lt;/a&gt;. These signs are heartening. In a system where the population’s interests should be considered by elected leaders, this means that the United States Government should be continuing its support for Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing public support for Ukraine should give Ukrainians some hope that the U.S. is not going to abandon them. But it is hard for the Ukrainians to hear that message when it is often drowned out by much more negative news about alleged backroom deals made between Putin’s couriers and individuals close to President Trump and the very real possibility that those couriers are using their access to actively pursue a whisper campaign to influence the President and his policy decisions. That, combined with targeted leaks and distortions of facts to exaggerate the perception that Washington now prefers Moscow to Ukraine and the Europeans is painting a Russian-preferred narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What national security news are you missing today?

I also agree that as the elected leader of the most powerful country in the world, President Trump has a responsibility to try to end the bloody and senseless conflict. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The President deserves credit for trying, although I do not agree with his periodic claims that the Ukrainians, or their President, are guilty of starting the war - or that Kyiv does not want to end the war. Vladimir Putin is guilty of starting the conflict and despite all of President Trump’s efforts and the Ukrainians willingness to try to find a compromise, Putin has &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/putin-opens-annual-presser-with-maximalist-demands/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;continued to make maximalist demands&lt;/a&gt; and drag out the conflict in hopes of stealing more of Ukraine’s territory and feeding Russia’s defense industrial complex, which is now the sole functioning part of Russia’s struggling economy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appeared President Trump recognized this reality in October, when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-putin-summit-cancelled-after-moscow-sent-memo-washington-ft-reports-2025-10-31/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt; plans to meet with Putin in Budapest and levied &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/do-oil-sanctions-still-work&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;new sanctions&lt;/a&gt; on the Russian Energy sector. Unfortunately, the President allowed Putin to manipulate the U.S. team into thinking Putin was ready to negotiate in November, opening the door to a lot of Russian disinformation and information warfare designed to undermine the U.S., Ukraine and its allies - but not designed to bring the war to an end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I have seen the level of political infighting within Ukraine increase. During a discussion with one Ukrainian General in September of 2024, the General opined that historically, Ukraine had never lost a war to Russia but had lost many wars to itself. He warned that internal political struggles in the country allowed the Russians to identify and exploit the political ambitions of some leaders and use these ambitions to divide the country and undermine national unity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is again facing the threat of serious internal divisions that the Kremlin will manipulate and use to achieve its military and political objectives. It appears likely that the Ukrainian government will hold elections in 2026, and the U.S. and the West should be ready to help Kyiv protect those elections from Russian interference. There is also little doubt that Russia itself will not hold fair elections in 2026 or as long as Putin remains in power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an American, I pray that our elected leaders will not repeat the mistakes made by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain when trying to deal with Adolf Hitler. The appeasement of Hitler by forcing allies to cede territories to the Nazi regime in Berlin did not lead to “Peace in our Time”. It led to a much greater and more horrific World War that could have been stopped if the English and French had taken decisive action against Hitler at that time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To “Make America Great Again”, Americans need to stand up for what is right. Right - is not appeasing Putin. Justice is not allowing Putin to get away with stealing large portions of Ukraine’s territory and then benefit from killing more than a million Ukrainian and Russian citizens in a war that was designed to protect Putin’s personal power and re-establish an empire that has collapsed twice in the last 150 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an American, I pray that we find our way through this very confusing and troubled period, hold the aggressor, Putin, accountable for his crimes, and successfully bring this war to an end while protecting Ukraine’s sovereignty and America’s reputation in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the US Government.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With each crisis over the past 15 years, the Federal Reserve has expanded the scope and scale of its interventions. This gradual mission creep has blurred the line between routine liquidity support and support for insolvent institutions, undermining the very purpose of central-bank independence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The U.S. Military’s Newest Enemy: Fentanyl</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-u-s-militarys-newest-enemy-fentanyl</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/photo-by-matt-mcclain-the-washington-post-via-getty-images.jpg?id=62624280&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;“There's no doubt that America's adversaries are trafficking fentanyl into the United States in part because they want to kill Americans. If this were a war, that would be one of the worst wars. I believe they killed over the last five or six years, per year, 200-to-300,000 people. You hear about a 100,000, which is a lot of people, but the number is much higher than that. That's been proven.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was President Trump in the Oval Office on December 15, explaining why he was signing an Executive Order (EO) designating “illicit fentanyl and its core precursor chemicals as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/12/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-designates-fentanyl-as-a-weapon-of-mass-destruction/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Weapons of Mass Destruction&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (WMD).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice Trump’s use of the word “war,” and the vast exaggeration of numbers of fentanyl drug deaths in the U.S. -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107667&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;actually 48,000 in 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Also, does anyone really think that the cartels are pushing fentanyl into this country “to kill Americans?” Or is the real reason they are doing it is to make money – as is the case with most drug dealers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am focusing on this rather odd EO because to me it is another sign that President Trump is bringing the U.S. military into yet another essentially domestic American problem, drug use. I also see it as the Trump administration regularizing employment of the U.S. military to be a normal response to control civil issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, President Trump has employed some 9,000 active and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/national-guard-posse-comitatus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Guard service members&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the U.S. southern border to block what he termed an invasion of illegal immigrants. He has also federalized National Guard troops in U.S. cities like Washington, D.C. claiming they were needed to combat crime, and required hundreds of Marines and originally 4,000 California National Guard personnel in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/los-angeles-protests-national-guard&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to put down protests against immigration raids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was even a military atmosphere in the Oval Office on December 15, because the President used that same meeting to make the first awards of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/4360811/trump-awards-soldiers-marines-border-defense-medal/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mexican Border Defense Medal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to 13 Army and Marine service members who provided military support to the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Oval Office meeting, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth explained that the newly-issued medal exactly replicated the 1918 Mexican Border Defense Medal, but that one went to U.S. troops who patrolled the border during 1916-1917, when fear was of a German-inspired invasion by the paramilitary forces of Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa as part of the Mexican Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It’s never been more important to understand what’s happening in the world.

The EO said, “The production and sale of fentanyl by Foreign Terrorist Organizations and cartels fund these entities’ operations — which include assassinations, terrorist acts, and insurgencies around the world — and allow these entities to erode our domestic security and the well-being of our Nation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, this EO seeks to link up with one of President Trump’s first EOs, signed on January 20, that designated unspecified cartels as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/designating-cartels-and-other-organizations-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations-and-specially-designated-global-terrorists/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Foreign Terrorists Organizations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to make them subject to laws Congress passed in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new December 15 EO goes on to say, “The two cartels that are predominantly responsible for the distribution of fentanyl in the United States engage in armed conflict over territory and to protect their operations, resulting in large-scale violence and death that go beyond the immediate threat of fentanyl itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inexplicably, the EO does not name those two cartels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/2025NationalDrugThreatAssessment.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2025 National Drug Threat Assessment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; makes it clear who they are by saying, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/mexican-drug-cartels&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation Cartels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, control clandestine [fentanyl] production sites in Mexico, smuggling routes into the United States, and distribution hubs in key U.S. cities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then both the new EO and &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2025 National Drug Threat Assessment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; carry the exact same following sentence: “Further, the potential for fentanyl to be weaponized for concentrated, large-scale terror attacks by organized adversaries is a serious threat to the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that back in the 1990s, a number of countries investigated using fentanyl as part of an incapacitating agent, including the U.S. Defense Department. The U.S. dropped the idea because of a margin of safety issue – the difference between a dosage that would incapacitate and one that would kill a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the Russians did create a fentanyl-based incapacitating agent and used it in October 2002, when 40 Chechen terrorists seized Moscow’s Dubrovka Theater and held some 800 people hostage. Russians finally released the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nonproliferation.org/the-moscow-theater-hostage-crisis-incapacitants-and-chemical-warfare/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fentanyl-based gas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to incapacitate those in the theater and it killed some 130 of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fentanyl is an FDA-approved synthetic opioid used medically as a pain reliever and anesthetic. It is close to 100 times stronger than morphine. Two milligrams of fentanyl -- equivalent to 10-to-15 grains of table salt – can be lethal. Unlike other illegal drugs such as cocaine, wholesale traffickers distribute fentanyl by the kilogram, equal to 2.2 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DEA has found wide U.S. usage of illicit, manufactured, counterfeit fentanyl pills ranging from .02 to 5.1 milligrams, the latter more than twice the lethal dose depending on a person’s body size, tolerance and past usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fentanyl illegal drug use has been a major problem in the U.S. since 2021 when overdose deaths reached &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/cdc-estimates-more-than-107000-americans-died-of-drug-overdoses-in-2021-setting-staggering-record#:~:text=Dr.,made%20treatment%20harder%20to%20get.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;71,000&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But as shown above overdose fentanyl deaths are on the way down. President Trump even recognized fentanyl use had gone down saying in the Oval Office on December 15, “We've also achieved a 50% drop in the amount of fentanyl coming across the border and China is working with us very closely and bringing down the number and the amount of fentanyl that's being shipped…We've got it down to a much lower number.” But Trump added, “Not satisfactory, but it will be satisfactory soon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today. Gain access to save your virtual seat now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “weapon of mass destruction” has specific legal definitions, typically tied to nuclear, radiological, chemical, or biological weapons that are &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to cause large-scale death or bodily harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the Trump WMD EO, implementation calls for Defense Secretary Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi to determine if the U.S. military is needed to enforce 10 U.S.C. 282, a post-9/11, 2002 counterterrorism law covering emergency situations involving weapons of mass destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they agree the military is needed, under 10 U.S.C. 282 Hegseth and Bondi are to “jointly prescribe regulations concerning the types of assistance that may be provided,” and “describe the actions that Department of Defense personnel may take in circumstances incident to the provision of assistance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are provisions in 10 U.S.C. 282 prohibiting the military from authority to arrest individuals, directly participate in searches or seizures of evidence related law violations or collection of intelligence for law enforcement – but those provisions also can also be waived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, under the Trump EO, Hegseth is to consult with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to “update all directives regarding the Armed Forces’ response to chemical incidents in the homeland to include the threat of illicit fentanyl.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I go into all these details because I believe something other than fentanyl is involved here. Others are questioning the December 15 EO, such as Andrew McCarthy in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/12/trump-has-no-authority-to-categorize-fentanyl-as-a-weapon-of-mass-destruction/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on December 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCarthy wrote, “President Trump may despise ‘forever wars,’ but he sure seems to like pretend wars. The point of the fentanyl ‘designation’ is to shore up his case for using military force against drug traffickers — although its relevance to high seas around Venezuela is hard to fathom since fentanyl is neither produced nor imported from there. At any rate, fentanyl, a dangerous drug but one with legitimate medical uses, is a narcotic, not a weapon of mass destruction akin to a chemical or biological bomb.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, &lt;a href=&quot;http://military.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Military.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, “The [December 15] Executive Order does not spell out a specific military mission, and Pentagon officials have not yet stated whether the armed forces will take on a direct role under the new designation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the EO creates yet another new, domestic area for military operations within the homeland, and what emerges needs to be watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>What It Means Now that Fentanyl is Designated a “WMD”</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/fentanyl-weapon-of-mass-destruction</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;“There's no doubt that America's adversaries are trafficking fentanyl into the United States in part because they want to kill Americans. If this were a war, that would be one of the worst wars. I believe they killed over the last five or six years, per year, 200-to-300,000 people. You hear about a 100,000, which is a lot of people, but the number is much higher than that. That's been proven.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was President Trump in the Oval Office on December 15, explaining why he was signing an Executive Order (EO) designating “illicit fentanyl and its core precursor chemicals as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/12/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-designates-fentanyl-as-a-weapon-of-mass-destruction/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Weapons of Mass Destruction&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (WMD).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice Trump’s use of the word “war,” and the vast exaggeration of numbers of fentanyl drug deaths in the U.S. -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107667&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;actually 48,000 in 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Also, does anyone really think that the cartels are pushing fentanyl into this country “to kill Americans?” Or is the real reason they are doing it is to make money – as is the case with most drug dealers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am focusing on this rather odd EO because to me it is another sign that President Trump is bringing the U.S. military into yet another essentially domestic American problem, drug use. I also see it as the Trump administration regularizing employment of the U.S. military to be a normal response to control civil issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, President Trump has employed some 9,000 active and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/national-guard-posse-comitatus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Guard service members&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the U.S. southern border to block what he termed an invasion of illegal immigrants. He has also federalized National Guard troops in U.S. cities like Washington, D.C. claiming they were needed to combat crime, and required hundreds of Marines and originally 4,000 California National Guard personnel in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/los-angeles-protests-national-guard&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to put down protests against immigration raids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was even a military atmosphere in the Oval Office on December 15, because the President used that same meeting to make the first awards of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/4360811/trump-awards-soldiers-marines-border-defense-medal/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mexican Border Defense Medal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to 13 Army and Marine service members who provided military support to the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Oval Office meeting, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth explained that the newly-issued medal exactly replicated the 1918 Mexican Border Defense Medal, but that one went to U.S. troops who patrolled the border during 1916-1917, when fear was of a German-inspired invasion by the paramilitary forces of Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa as part of the Mexican Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

The EO said, “The production and sale of fentanyl by Foreign Terrorist Organizations and cartels fund these entities’ operations — which include assassinations, terrorist acts, and insurgencies around the world — and allow these entities to erode our domestic security and the well-being of our Nation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, this EO seeks to link up with one of President Trump’s first EOs, signed on January 20, that designated unspecified cartels as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/designating-cartels-and-other-organizations-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations-and-specially-designated-global-terrorists/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Foreign Terrorists Organizations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to make them subject to laws Congress passed in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new December 15 EO goes on to say, “The two cartels that are predominantly responsible for the distribution of fentanyl in the United States engage in armed conflict over territory and to protect their operations, resulting in large-scale violence and death that go beyond the immediate threat of fentanyl itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inexplicably, the EO does not name those two cartels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/2025NationalDrugThreatAssessment.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2025 National Drug Threat Assessment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; makes it clear who they are by saying, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/mexican-drug-cartels&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation Cartels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, control clandestine [fentanyl] production sites in Mexico, smuggling routes into the United States, and distribution hubs in key U.S. cities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then both the new EO and &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2025 National Drug Threat Assessment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; carry the exact same following sentence: “Further, the potential for fentanyl to be weaponized for concentrated, large-scale terror attacks by organized adversaries is a serious threat to the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that back in the 1990s, a number of countries investigated using fentanyl as part of an incapacitating agent, including the U.S. Defense Department. The U.S. dropped the idea because of a margin of safety issue – the difference between a dosage that would incapacitate and one that would kill a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the Russians did create a fentanyl-based incapacitating agent and used it in October 2002, when 40 Chechen terrorists seized Moscow’s Dubrovka Theater and held some 800 people hostage. Russians finally released the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nonproliferation.org/the-moscow-theater-hostage-crisis-incapacitants-and-chemical-warfare/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fentanyl-based gas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to incapacitate those in the theater and it killed some 130 of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fentanyl is an FDA-approved synthetic opioid used medically as a pain reliever and anesthetic. It is close to 100 times stronger than morphine. Two milligrams of fentanyl -- equivalent to 10-to-15 grains of table salt – can be lethal. Unlike other illegal drugs such as cocaine, wholesale traffickers distribute fentanyl by the kilogram, equal to 2.2 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DEA has found wide U.S. usage of illicit, manufactured, counterfeit fentanyl pills ranging from .02 to 5.1 milligrams, the latter more than twice the lethal dose depending on a person’s body size, tolerance and past usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fentanyl illegal drug use has been a major problem in the U.S. since 2021 when overdose deaths reached &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/cdc-estimates-more-than-107000-americans-died-of-drug-overdoses-in-2021-setting-staggering-record#:~:text=Dr.,made%20treatment%20harder%20to%20get.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;71,000&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But as shown above overdose fentanyl deaths are on the way down. President Trump even recognized fentanyl use had gone down saying in the Oval Office on December 15, “We've also achieved a 50% drop in the amount of fentanyl coming across the border and China is working with us very closely and bringing down the number and the amount of fentanyl that's being shipped…We've got it down to a much lower number.” But Trump added, “Not satisfactory, but it will be satisfactory soon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today.

      <title>Trying to Impose a Loser’s Peace on Ukraine Is a Dead End</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-losers-peace-dead-end</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;The fate of territory in eastern Ukraine remains the “most difficult” sticking point in the ongoing peace talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky&lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/alternatives-to-us-support-are-uncertain-zelensky-says-strength-to-end-war-exists-with-trump-names-most-difficult-issues-in-negotiations/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;acknowledged&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend as U.S. negotiators held separate meetings with Ukrainian and Russian officials. In pursuit of peace, the Trump administration is pushing Ukraine to bend to maximalist Kremlin demands that Russia has failed to impose militarily, while promising Kyiv “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/15/us-ukraine-security-guarantees/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;platinum standard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” security guarantees to sweeten the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach is unlikely to succeed — and may prove harmful. The administration would be wise to focus instead on pressing Russia to soften its terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putin Demands Victory He Hasn’t Earned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of his conditions for peace, Vladimir Putin&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgexgwr1wrro&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;insists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Ukrainian troops withdraw from the roughly 23 percent of the eastern Donetsk region they still control. He vows that if Kyiv refuses, his military will take that territory anyways. Putin seems convinced that Russia eventually can grind down Ukraine’s undermanned forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some U.S. officials have&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2025/11/19/trump-ukraine-peace-plan-russia-donbas&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;echoed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; those&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/us-army-secretary-warned-ukraine-imminent-defeat-pushing-initial-peace-rcna245704&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;arguments&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, apparently believing that pressuring Kyiv into concessions offers the surest path to peace. As President Donald Trump recently&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/donald-trump-full-interview-transcript-00681693&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;put it&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Russia is “much bigger” than Ukraine, and “at some point, size will win.” Ukraine is “losing,” Trump contended, so it must “accept” Russian demands. An initial U.S.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/79eefaf8-2fc1-47ac-9653-24cf6a0239f5&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;peace plan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; released in November, drafted with Russian input, called for Ukraine to cede the remainder of Donetsk, which would become a “demilitarized buffer zone,” which Washington is now pitching as a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/746f1c06-6dbb-4ae2-86a4-916acbfdecf2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;free economic zone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s anything but certain that Russian forces can conquer the rest of Donetsk. They would need to seize a so-called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/ec490909-80e5-48ff-a518-8185a6a5d2c7&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fortress belt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” of cities and towns, just one of which — Pokrovsk — has taken Russia over a year to capture despite advantages in manpower and materiel. Despite&lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/07/23/ukraine-war-drone-air-battle-russia-technology-tactics/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;improvements&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in drone warfare, Russia has remained unable to achieve a major breakthrough. That’s partly due to degraded force quality, which is unlikely to recover while large-scale hostilities continue. Russia can continue inching forward so long as it can recruit enough men to throw into the “meatgrinder.” Since 2023, Moscow has maintained a surprisingly strong recruitment rate thanks to ever-larger financial incentives. But that can’t last forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Ukrainian forces are weary and short on infantry, they are not on the verge of breaking. Ukraine continues to put up a stout defense, relying chiefly on Ukrainian-made drones to inflict disproportionate casualties. The decline in American aid has hurt. But even a complete cutoff probably wouldn’t trigger a collapse, though it would mean more Ukrainian lives lost and infrastructure destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, Putin is demanding that Ukraine accept defeat despite the inconvenient fact that Russia hasn’t defeated Ukraine on the battlefield and is unlikely to do so. As long as that remains the case, lopsided peace plans will be a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a “Zelensky problem.” Recent&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/vast-majority-ukrainians-reject-major-peace-concessions-poll-finds-2025-12-15/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;polling&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; indicates that the Ukrainian people still overwhelmingly reject ceding more territory, seen as synonymous with capitulation. Many in the Ukrainian military are understandably loathe to cede defensible terrain for which Ukrainians have bled for nearly four years. No Ukrainian leader will agree to a deal that would mean political suicide. Even if Zelensky did try to capitulate, it could ignite domestic political&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/12/03/8010090/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;instability&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and undermine morale, which Russia would seek to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Although Washington has made clear it won’t allow Ukraine to join NATO, U.S. officials touted an “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/15/us-ukraine-security-guarantees/#:~:text=really%20strong%20guarantees%2C-,Article%205%2Dlike,-%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20one%20U&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Article 5-like&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” commitment during recent talks in Berlin. This has enthused Ukrainian and European officials, who are rightly concerned Russia will violate any peace agreement it signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House, though, should take care not to make empty promises. Ukraine must not be left with another 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which gave Kyiv hollow security assurances in exchange for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/nuclear-proliferation-crisis&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;relinquishing nuclear weapons&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; inherited from the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the administration has released few details regarding the specific commitments it made in Berlin, press&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/16/world/europe/ukraine-security-guarantees-talks.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; indicate elements of the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/ukraine-security-plan-offers-robust-protections-officials-say&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;plan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are sensible. The Ukrainian Armed Forces would be permitted to maintain a peacetime strength of 800,000 troops and would receive Western training and equipment, defying Moscow’s demand for Ukrainian demilitarization. A U.S.-led international monitoring and verification mechanism would ensure compliance with a ceasefire, and a deconfliction mechanism would work to prevent escalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2025/11/21/ukraine-security-guarantee-nato-article-5-trump&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;earlier media leaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/12/15/leaders-statement-on-ukraine/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;European statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; released following the Berlin talks, suggest Washington may also be offering a non-committal promise to respond with measures up to and including “armed force” if Russia re-invaded Ukraine. The Trump team says it will grant Kyiv’s request to seek Senate approval to make this pledge legally binding. Even so, the threat of U.S. military intervention lacks credibility. Both Trump and his Democratic predecessors have eschewed direct conflict with Russia over Ukraine. That’s unlikely to change under a future president, especially since Washington is trying to focus on deterring China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the White House is betting its bluff won’t be called, it should think again. However the current war ends, it’s unlikely to resolve Russia’s decades-long struggle to dominate Ukraine and reshape the European security order. Moscow will be racing to reconstitute its army, drawing on lessons learned in Ukraine and expanded defense-industrial capacity. Another Russian invasion is a distinct possibility. And if America’s “Article 5-like” guarantee is revealed to be hollow, it could undermine the credibility of the actual Article 5, weakening NATO deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As another part of the security guarantee package, the Trump administration apparently has agreed to support a British- and French-led multinational force in Ukraine. After hostilities cease, countries from the so-called “Coalition of the Willing” would&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-coalition-of-the-willing-headquarters-as-leaders-step-up-support-for-ukraines-immediate-flight&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;help&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; police Ukraine’s skies, clear naval mines, and regenerate the Ukrainian army. This would include deployments of Europe troops to Ukraine (though far from the front lines) — an idea which Moscow vehemently opposes. Other than ruling out putting American boots on the ground, the administration hasn’t publicly specified how it would support this force (likely&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/66ec25a0-4af8-467f-9fbe-cf42de890a7e&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;involving&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and possibly other so-called “strategic enablers”). Nor has Washington publicly agreed to provide an air-power “backstop” if that force were attacked. If a ceasefire looks shaky and no U.S. backstop is committed, European countries will be more reluctant to put troops in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that tying the force’s deployment to a ceasefire incentivizes Russia to prolong the war. Putin invaded Ukraine precisely to reverse its Westward drift, and Moscow insists that any peace settlement must bar Western troops from the country — a demand that earlier&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/79eefaf8-2fc1-47ac-9653-24cf6a0239f5&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;drafts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the&lt;a href=&quot;https://zn.ua/ukr/amp/WORLD/novij-mirnij-plan-trampa-do-choho-primushujut-ukrajinu-analiz-chotirokh-dokumentiv.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;U.S. peace plan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sought to satisfy. As British scholar Jack Watling has&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/ukraines-hardest-winter&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;argued&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Europe could obviate the Russian veto commencing with air policing and training in western Ukraine now, before the war ends. Yet European capitals remain unwilling to do so, wary of escalation with Russia. That same fear undermines the force’s deterrent value in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today. Gain access to save your virtual seat now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Path to Peace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than gunning for a quick but lopsided deal, Washington should patiently focus on shifting the Kremlin’s calculus. Moscow has&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-envoy-kellogg-says-ukraine-peace-deal-is-really-close-2025-12-07/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;made clear&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that its ambitions go well beyond Donetsk. In essence, Putin seeks a settlement that locks Ukraine within Russia’s sphere of influence. Given the maximalist nature of Putin’s demands, peace will remain impossible unless Moscow reduces its expectations considerably. Ukraine will also have to make concessions, including on its NATO aspirations. But Russia is the primary obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perversely, pressuring Ukraine to cede more territory could put a deal farther from reach. By attempting to strong-arm Kyiv, echoing Kremlin arguments about the inevitability of Russian advances, and reducing military aid for Ukraine, Washington risks hardening Putin’s intransigence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequences could also extend beyond Ukraine. Since the Second World War, the United States has led the free world in opposing the acquisition of territory by military means. Discarding that now could shake allied trust in America while emboldening adversaries such as China. President Trump is right to push for peace in Ukraine, but the medicine must not be worse than the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So long as Putin is overconfident in his military prospects and feels no sense of urgency to end the war, he is unlikely to make the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/putin-sets-trap-for-u-s-negotiators&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;necessary compromises&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Russian autocrat must be made to realize that more war will bring nothing but pain. The European Union just took an important step by&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-welcomes-90-billion-euro-eu-loan-despite-lack-deal-russian-assets-2025-12-19/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;pledging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 90 billion euros to shore up Kyiv’s state budget through 2027. The United States should do its part, too. Washington could bolster Ukraine’s bargaining position by surging military assistance, much of which could be financed by Europe. This effort should include support for Kyiv’s air defense and long-range strike capabilities, helping Ukraine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-winter-coming&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;endure the winter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and impose greater costs on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Washington should&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2025/11/25/to-build-leverage-for-peace-enforce-oil-sanctions-on-russia/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;stringently enforce&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and build on its recent sanctions targeting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/do-oil-sanctions-still-work&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Russia’s top oil companies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Treasury Department should target unsanctioned Russian oil suppliers as well as other entities, vessels, and infrastructure that help bring that oil to market. Western countries could further ramp up the pressure by&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-g7-weigh-ban-maritime-services-russian-oil-exports-end-price-cap-2025-12-05/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;replacing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the Biden-era price cap on Russian oil flows with a full ban on providing shipping or financial services for those exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Kyiv’s Western partners should encourage the Ukrainian military to fight smarter. Ukraine must stop wasting precious manpower&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/12/10/8011187/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;clinging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to semi-encircled towns or counterattacking to reclaim insignificant positions. This penchant stems in part from concerns that admitting to battlefield setbacks would discourage U.S. support and fuel calls for territorial concessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainians aren’t going to give Russia more than it can take by force of arms. Rather than trying to do Putin’s dirty work for him, Washington should put its energies into convincing Moscow to accept realistic terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>X’s Location Feature Exposes a Real Problem, but Does Not Fix It</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/x-location-feature-disinformation</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;A new location transparency feature on X is&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj38m11218xo&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;revealing foreign influence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on American discourse just as federal agencies designed to deal with such threats are being dismantled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techbuzz.ai/articles/x-rolls-out-profile-transparency-feature-to-combat-bots&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;November&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, X began listing&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.x.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-change-country-settings&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;account locations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the “About this account” section of people’s (or bots’) profiles. X also can list the platform through which users access the social media site, such as the web app or a region-specific app store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these new transparency features, X exposed that major&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/x-new-location-transparency-feature-questions-origins-maga-accounts-rcna245487&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;MAGA influencers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are likely operating from Eastern Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia. And while anti-Trump profiles posing as Americans on X haven’t made headlines, the authors found one&lt;a href=&quot;https://ghostarchive.org/archive/2SkDY&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;listing itself in Charlotte, NC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that X indicates&lt;a href=&quot;https://ghostarchive.org/archive/pHymu&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;connected via the Nigeria App Store&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One factor driving foreign accounts to masquerade as domestic political commentators could be commercial gain. Heated political debate, abundant in the United States, drives engagement, which can be monetized. Account owners posing as Americans may also be funded or operated by America’s adversaries who seek to shape votes, increase social divisions, or achieve other strategic goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem of foreign adversaries pretending to be American is not new. During the cold war, Soviet KGB agents even&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/08/07/us-ties-klan-olympic-hate-mail-to-kgb/80918fe8-fcf0-46cf-bb58-726ee46d8ce9/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;posed as KKK members&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and sent hate mail to Olympic athletes before the 1984 summer Olympics. What is different now is the scale and speed of influence operations. The internet makes it dramatically easier for foreign adversaries to pose as Americans and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/disinformation-human-algorithim&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;infiltrate domestic discourse&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past decade provides countless examples of Russia, China, and Iran &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/us-intelligence-russia-china-and-iran-in-election-propaganda-blitz&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;targeting Americans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with online influence operations. In 2022, a Chinese operation masqueraded as&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/dragonbridge-targets-rare-earths-mining-companies&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;environmental activists in Texas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to stoke protests against rare earth processing plants. Iran posed as the Proud Boys to send voters&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/two-iranian-nationals-charged-cyber-enabled-disinformation-and-threat-campaign-designed&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;threatening emails&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; before the 2020 elections. In 2014, Russia spread a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-are-russian-trolls-spreading-online-hoaxes-in-the-u-s&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;hoax about a chemical plant explosion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;X’s new country of origin feature is a step in the right direction for combatting these operations. Using it, a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cd6xyjj0gnjt?post=asset%3A2ba54356-2607-4b9e-947e-3bdb84143475&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;BBC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; investigation revealed that multiple accounts advocating for Scottish independence connect to the platform via the Iran Android App. On first blush, this makes little sense. But Iran has a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clemson.edu/centers-institutes/watt/hub/images/hiding-under-the-kilt1.pdf#page=16&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;documented history&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of promoting Scottish independence through covert online influence operations and a track record of sowing discord wherever it can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

Identifying an account’s location does not always tell you who directs or funds the account. For example, Russia has previously&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/13/facebook-uncovers-russian-led-troll-network-based-in-west-africa&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;outsourced its attempts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to influence Americans to operators in Ghana and Nigeria. America’s adversaries continue to leverage proxies in their operations, as seen in a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeticwarfare.io/p/guest-post-lagos-doesnt-believe-in&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;recently exposed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nigerian YouTube network aggressively spreading&lt;a href=&quot;https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/1195/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;pro-Kremlin narratives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, malign actors will likely still be able to spoof their location on X. Virtual private networks (VPNs) mask a user’s real IP address, and while X appears to flag suspected VPN use, the platform may have a harder time detecting&lt;a href=&quot;https://nordvpn.com/blog/residential-proxies/?srsltid=AfmBOoqYyOJ6-Ap93DSv0iEhTJdt-PUDau9QTjpKRuJsWMO0dv9l7JeT&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;residential proxies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which route traffic through a home IP address. Sophisticated operators and privacy enthusiasts will likely find additional ways to spoof their location. For example, TikTok tracks user locations but there are&lt;a href=&quot;https://nordvpn.com/blog/how-to-change-location-on-tiktok/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;easy-to-find guides&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on how to change one’s apparent location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional data points provided by X’s transparency feature, therefore, do not provide a shortcut to attributing a nation-state or other malign actor behind an influence operation. Proper attribution still requires thorough investigation, supported by both regional and technical expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Platforms have access to internal data — such as emails used to create an account and other technical indicators — that allow them to have a fuller picture about who is behind an account. Non-profits across the United States, Europe, Australia, and other aligned countries have also successfully exposed many influence operations in the past purely through open-source intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government, however, plays a unique role in countering influence operations. Only governments have the authority to issue subpoenas, access sensitive sources, and impose consequences through sanctions and indictments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington, however, has significantly reduced its capabilities to combat foreign malign influence. Over the past year, it has dismantled the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force, shut down the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justsecurity.org/119653/wjh-dismantling-foreign-malign-influence-center/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;effectively dismantled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the Foreign Malign Influence Center at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. These changes make it unclear who — if anyone — within the U.S. government oversees countering influence operations undermining American interests at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;X’s new transparency feature reveals yet again that America’s adversaries are waging near-constant warfare against Americans on the devices and platforms that profoundly shape our beliefs and behaviors. Now the U.S. government must rebuild its capacity to address it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the world becomes more multipolar, geopolitical tensions are hampering efforts to devise common solutions to shared problems, and developments within many countries are threatening the institutions on which multilateralism depends. Mission-driven, public-private partnerships like Gavi may offer the only way forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>We Need More Than Just a Command Shakeup in the U.S. Military</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/us-military-command-shakeup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/12/15/military-command-plan-caine-hegseth/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; came out last week that claim the Chairman of Joint Staff, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/dan-caine-global-hotspots&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;General Dan Caine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is preparing a new unified command plan (UCP) that will reorganize and consolidate the regional combatant commands. According to press reports, the proposal, which is to go to the Secretary and the President soon, would combine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-u-s-has-40000-troops-in-the-middle-east&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. Central Command&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa Command under a new U.S. International Command. U.S. Southern Command and U.S. Northern Command would be combined as U.S. Americas Command. For now, the functional commands, U.S. Cyber Command, U.S. Special Operations Command, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/u-s-mission-in-space-maintaining-credibility-to-deter&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. Space Command&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. Strategic Command and U.S. Transportation Command and U.S. Indo Pacific Command would remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this happens, it would be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-12-19/hegseth-is-targeting-the-military-s-constitution&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;biggest command shake up&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in decades. However, to truly have the greatest effect, &lt;a href=&quot;https://responsiblestatecraft.org/hegseth-commands-generals/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;more needs to happen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than just a reorganization and consolidation of combatant commands. The work to change and upgrade the combatant commands must be more consequential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this to happen, these commands must have all the tools at their disposal to develop military relationships and oversee operations in their regions. To be most effective, that means that their intelligence and their interagency arms must be bolstered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/intelligence-community-technology-reform&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;intelligence side&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Washington should push out the work to the combatant commands that the analysts, targeters and operators are doing in D.C. Before the early 2000s, the combatant commands hired their intelligence professionals through the services. In the early 2000s, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dia.mil/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; took over the requirement to integrate all the combatant commands’ intelligence professionals and those professionals became DIA employees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been great success with increased and more consistent training and more sophisticated intelligence work at the combatant commands. More defense intelligence enterprise professionals now have a first-hand understanding of providing support to military activities. However, there is much more work to do in this area. A vast majority of the Washington DIA employees do not have direct experience working with warfighters on tactical issues or have forgotten their experience in this area. There is also often a duplication of efforts on analysis, reporting, and collection between DIA headquarters and the combatant commands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all can be streamlined by pushing those DC-based professionals to the combatant commands. DIA headquarters should be small and highly focused on manning, training, equipping, and integrating. The analysts, operators and targeters should be working directly with the warfighters under the direction of the combatant commander or at the Pentagon directly for the Chairman, Joint Staff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, DIA headquarters should provide the HR, the training programs, the data, and the technology for the rest of the DIA enterprise to support each combatant Commander and his warfighters directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

A key role for Combatant Command senior leaders is to develop relationships with military partners in their region. This will become more difficult as a Combatant Commander’s geographic outreach grows. Each Commander will need more tools and senior professionals to help develop those relationships. To assist in this and to underscore the need for interagency coordination, Combatant Commands should have dual leadership from the civilian sector and military. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most regional commands now have a senior foreign policy advisor, usually at Ambassador rank, who advises the commander on foreign relations. This position needs to be enhanced to a true deputy position vice an advisor. At the same time, the combatant commands need senior representatives from major government departments such as the Department of Homeland Security, Treasury, Commerce, and FBI. This will enhance the U.S.’ ability to compete against our adversaries by offering tools to use with foreign governments that are integrated and coordinated across the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time is right to make more consequential changes to a system that needs to modernize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>A Blueprint for Next-Generation Defense Production</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/blueprint-next-generation-defense-production</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;The Pentagon’s push to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5595767-pentagon-overhaul-weapons-acquisition/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;overhaul&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; its slow, specification-driven &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/defense-acquisition-arsenal-freedom&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;procurement system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an overdue acknowledgment that our defense industrial base has become too narrow, too fragile, and too dependent on foreign supply chains. America’s defense establishment is finally waking up to a critical weakness that has metastasized in recent decades: we have drifted away from the industrial might that once formed the bedrock of our economy and allowed us to out-produce any adversary in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are many warning signs, one symptom of the problem is unmistakably clear: the United States is not producing what it needs at the speed and scale modern conflict demands. Recent reporting shows the U.S. Army is still struggling to meet its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2025/8/14/army-falls-short-of-155mm-production-goal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;155mm artillery-shell production goals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after years of effort. Across the spectrum—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fpri.org/article/2025/10/americas-scale-problem/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;from advanced missile interceptors to something as basic as black powder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—we are falling dangerously behind in both production capacity and supply-chain resilience. For now, these shortfalls are appearing in conflicts that don’t directly involve American troops, but the truth is that a major war will see the United States forced to ration materials and munitions, deploying untested prototypes on the battlefield while the defense industrial base races to catch up. We must act now to prevent this from happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we are serious about winning the next war—or better yet, deter it—we must &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/defense-acquisition-pentagon-steve-blank&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;rethink&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; both how we buy military equipment and weapons, and how fast we can make them. We don’t need another half measure or a fully government solution. Instead, the government should leverage the private sector to build a nationwide network of multifaceted, resilient manufacturing nodes that can surge production of everything from drones, vehicles, and body armor to medicine, munitions, and microelectronics in times of crisis, while sustaining production lines for commercial products in peacetime. The power of the U.S. economy can, and should, be leveraged to solve this problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This network of production centers, or campuses, would bring together startups and established manufacturers in the same ecosystem, enabling the kind of rapid prototyping, pilot production, and full-rate manufacturing the Pentagon is urgently seeking. Each of these campuses would be designed for flexibility, with modular production capabilities that can be rapidly upgraded, and shared heavy infrastructure such as test beds, utilities, and analytical systems. Furthermore, these facilities would be part of a connected national network, leveraging the regional strengths of each part of the country while avoiding the single points of failure commonly found in today’s highly concentrated manufacturing hubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

Major firms are often tied up maintaining legacy systems while cash-strapped startups cannot afford to build compliant, capital-intensive factories without production contracts. These startups are often told that contracts won’t come until they prove they can manufacture at scale. So promising technologies stall in a chicken-or-egg limbo while delays snowball. The Pentagon’s renewed embrace of OTAs helps, but money alone won’t fix a physical bottleneck. We need places where cutting-edge firms can scale quickly, and affordably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A national network of industrial campuses is designed to fill this gap. Under this model, companies wouldn’t pay construction costs up front; lease payments would begin only after they move in and start generating revenue. Layering into the model a certain number of shared facilities—initially funded by the Pentagon—would reduce risk, accelerate development, and dramatically shorten production timelines. Young companies gain room to grow. Established firms gain access to fresh innovation - and taxpayer dollars go further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a radical idea. It is an evolution of the model that once made America unstoppable. In World War II, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.war.gov/News/Feature-Stories/story/Article/2128446/during-wwii-industries-transitioned-from-peacetime-to-wartime-production/#:~:text=The%20Mattatuck%20Manufacturing%20Company%2C%20which,Production%20Poster&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;factories across the economy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—automotive, textile, consumer goods, and more—transformed to support the war effort. That surge capacity happened because the United States had an existing industrial ecosystem ready to mobilize. Today, we no longer have one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades of offshoring, consolidation, and a fixation on short-term efficiency have left our industrial base &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-9/forty-years-of-falling-manufacturing-employment.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;brittle and full of holes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. COVID-19 made that painfully clear when the world’s largest economy found itself &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/2024/07/how-the-us-gained-and-then-lost-the-ability-to-make-medical-masks/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;dependent on foreign suppliers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for PPE and basic supplies. Semiconductor shortages still slow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/05/27/1101701890/javelin-missiles-are-in-short-supply-and-restocking-them-won-t-be-easy&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;defense&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/cars/news/2025/10/31/automaker-disruptions-chips-crisis/87012992007/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;automotive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lines. Meanwhile, our adversaries are turning basic industries into warfighting assets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thedefensepost.com/2024/01/11/russian-bakery-drones-ukraine/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Russian bakeries are producing drones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/china-navy-fujian-sichuan&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;China&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is treating its manufacturing capabilities as a strategic weapon while in America, we’ve been treating our manufacturing base like an accounting exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It’s never been more important to understand what’s happening in the world.

Manufacturing is a strategic asset—every bit as important as ships, planes, satellites, or submarines. Washington should fund shared industrial infrastructure, de-risk private investment, and let market forces drive efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The math is simple. In some cases, companies piloting these programs have delivered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.war.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3143134/defense-department-launches-innovative-manufacturing-pilot-program/#:~:text=Copy%20Link,chemical%20manufacturing%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Dr.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;4:1 to 25:1 returns on tax dollars&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, generating major gains for minimal government investments. With a defense budget exceeding $800 billion, the Pentagon can easily afford to invest a sliver of that—well under one percent—to send a clear, unambiguous demand signal to the private sector that America is rebuilding its industrial backbone, and doing it now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History shows what happens when we do. Modest seed capital during World War II and the Apollo program unlocked massive private investment and generated hundreds of innovations that have come to define the modern age. These campuses would be more than factories—they would be hubs where manufacturers, universities, investors, and federal partners build self-sustaining ecosystems capable of accelerating innovation, fostering talent, and producing critical goods at scale. They would restore American industrial depth, innovation, and flexibility—our most reliable, most underestimated tools of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America is racing into the next &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/atlantic-council-strategy-paper-series/welcome-to-2035/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;complex era of great-power competition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a defense industrial base limping along from the last era; one that is simply too small, too fragile, and too slow. We can invent extraordinary technologies, but what use are they sitting in a lab if we can’t produce them at scale? If that doesn’t change, the United States risks discovering—too late—that innovation without industrial power is a hollow advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding American manufacturing will be difficult. But the cost of inaction is far higher. A nation with a deep, flexible industrial base can surge production, absorb economic shocks, and outlast any adversary, on the battlefield and the home front. A nation without one is forced to ration weapons, delay deployments, and scramble to keep its supply chains functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can build this network now or we can wait for a crisis to expose, once again, how fragile our industrial base has become. In the next conflict, the world’s strongest military must be able to depend on its factories to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since its creation, Europe’s carbon market has delivered significant emissions cuts, directed substantial resources toward clean-energy technologies, and become a model for other systems worldwide. But rising energy prices are fueling political pressure to relax carbon pricing, which would be a grave mistake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2025: 10 Events That Changed the World</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/2025-10-events-change-world</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/u-s-secretary-of-defense-pete-hegseth-gives-address-at-the-2025-reagan-national-defense-forum.jpg?id=62609682&amp;amp;width=1200&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPECIAL REPORT — &lt;/strong&gt;In a turbulent year, one of the biggest national security stories came in the form of a document.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Security Strategy (NSS)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, released earlier this month, upends longstanding U.S. policy toward allies and adversaries alike. It ranks drug trafficking and illegal immigration as top threats to U.S. security, places a heavy emphasis on the Western Hemisphere, criticizes Europe and downplays security challenges from China and Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight years ago, Trump's &lt;a href=&quot;https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;first NSS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said that “China and Russia challenge American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity.” The new NSS doesn’t name Russia as a threat to the U.S. – stating instead that “strategic stability with Russia” is a goal of American policy. Europe is presented as a bigger challenge; the U.S. should “help Europe correct its current trajectory,” which the NSS says has been damaged by immigration and a risk of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-warns-europe-faces-civilizational-erasure/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;civilizational erasure&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for China, the document focuses on economic competition – trade, infrastructure, and technology. References to Taiwan and the South China Sea come later, and they include warnings that other Asian nations must carry a greater burden; “the American military cannot, and should not have to, do this alone.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The north star of great-power competition with China and Russia—around which the first Trump administration built bipartisan consensus—is gone,” Rebecca Lissner, Senior Fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/unpacking-trump-twist-national-security-strategy&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the new NSS. The objective now, she said, is a “mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, European leaders were furious about the pivot to a more Russia-friendly posture, and what the European Council President called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://semafor.com/s/TMzbyGfQP2?email=tgnagorski@gmail.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;political interference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” in the affairs of Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glenn Corn, a former CIA Senior Executive, called the document’s treatment of Europe a “shock.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Europeans are not the enemy,” Corn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-winter-coming&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;“And I doubt the Russians will stand side by side with us on the battlefield and support us the way that our European partners have done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new NSS won praise from at least one global capital. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/china/kremlin-says-new-us-security-strategy-accords-largely-with-russias-view-2025-12-07/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; its emphasis on restoring strategic stability with Moscow “correspond in many ways” to Russia’s own vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;eb939&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=62609698&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infographic with a map of the Americas showing the areas where the United States has carried out attacks against alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean since September 2, 2025, as well as the number of people killed in these attacks, as of December 16 (Graphic by AFP via Getty Images)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missiles on the Water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;While the focus on narcotrafficking was clear from the early days of Trump’s second term, the heavy U.S. military deployments and air strikes in the Caribbean took experts by surprise. The aerial campaign began with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/boat-strike-survivors-hegseth-congress-legal-details-ce16f4740841b2b5f2904588335a818e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;September missile attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a small boat that killed 11 people; a second strike that day took the lives of two survivors who were clinging to the upturned vessel. The follow-on strike sparked criticism in Congress – including from Republicans – and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/are-deadly-us-strikes-alleged-drug-vessels-legal-2025-10-31/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;charges&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it might have violated maritime laws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of mid-December, at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/us-military-says-new-strikes-3-suspected-drug-boats-killed-8-board-rcna249433&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;25 strikes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had followed, including some in the Pacific, resulting in the deaths of more than 90 people alleged to have been smuggling drugs on the water. The Trump administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-maduro-drugs-venezuela-911-hegseth-3db3aafed492556bb9ca7de855c4849e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;justified the attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as necessary to stem a flow of fentanyl – which Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-venezuela-drug-war-fentanyl-weapon-b2885056.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;labeled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “a weapon of mass destruction” that has killed tens of thousands of Americans. Legal experts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/us/politics/trump-drug-cartels-war.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;questioned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whether passengers in these boats — even if they were found to have been carrying narcotics — could be considered enemy combatants.

Iran &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/explosions-heard-in-qatar-home-to-u-s-airbase-amid-iranian-threats-to-retaliate-for-strike-on-nuclear-sites&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fired missiles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at a U.S. base in Qatar but its overall retaliation was minimal, a consequence of earlier Israeli campaigns that weakened Iranian air defenses and its various militias in the Middle East. The 12-day war damaged elements of Iran’s nuclear program and laid bare a tectonic shift in the region: Iran and its “axis of resistance” had been badly weakened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, war-gaming scenarios had warned that any attack against Iran would carry risks of a conflagration, given the likelihood of a coordinated response from Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthi militia in Yemen. Now the paradigm has shifted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. joined Israel in military operations and people thought that had been a red line in the past,” Norman Roule, a former National Intelligence Manager for Iran at ODNI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-middle-east-is-reshuffling-the-deck&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;“For the nuclear negotiations and other talks going forward, Iran now has to deal with a new world where there is this precedent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the year ended, Iran remained a shell of what it had been, and reports suggested its leaders were conflicted about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jstreet.org/iran-policy-memo-what-comes-next/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;way forward&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Would the country recognize its weaknesses and move towards a rapprochement with the West — a move that might bring sanctions relief and usher in a new security dynamic in the region? Or would hardliners carry the day, resorting to one of the last levers Iran has – its nuclear program?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you're in Iran, you have to make a strategic decision,” Roule said. “‘If we restart the program, will the United States and Israel attack?’ They've got to ask, ‘If we do this, will we survive?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;09f7a&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=60322255&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office at the White House on February 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.

Trump’s subsequent meetings with Zelensky – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/face-to-face-at-the-vatican-how-trump-and-zelensky-made-up-344cb932?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcAnV09NdNoLfkepp3_RxRIXacMpzvQ2cyXmLyejRdFBEZJIWbWw7IETAPrqa0%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=6942dcc4&amp;amp;gaa_sig=0AVPrf7HwUsUC-ZDOcU0PSz8pETWLEn_w2DV_LmQ1r4LP5RjL-Fbh-bLsYtbb2WgArvkh9UDac029VPJhM3GYA%3D%3D&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;at the Vatican&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in April and the June &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/trump-meets-with-zelenskyy-at-nato-summit-says-ukraine-war-is-a-mess-for-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;NATO summit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – warmed the relationship; the NATO summit itself saw Trump pivot back toward the alliance and its support for Ukraine; and then – in a startling outburst – Trump in July &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2025/07/08/trump-putin-bullshit-sanctions-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;turned his ire&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; towards Russian President Vladimir Putin. “We get a lot of bull**** thrown at us by Putin,” Trump said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alas for Zelensky, at year’s end the pendulum looked to have swung back once more. Trump’s envoys were again pushing Russia-friendly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-winter-coming&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;peace proposals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which included the surrender of territory beyond what Russia has already occupied. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/trumps-frustration-with-ukraine-and-europe-boils-over-00683676&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Trump said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Zelensky, “He’s gonna have to get on the ball and start accepting things…cause he’s losing.” It sounded like a gentler version of the treatment Zelensky had gotten on that February day in the Oval Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;6c453&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=60355928&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;small class=&quot;image-media media-photo-credit&quot;&gt;            Photo by Wojtek Laski/Getty Images        &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Tu-95 bomber aircraft takes off for a night patrol flies out of Engels-2 airbase on August 7, 2008 in Engels, Russia.

An operation dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-attack-operation-spiderweb-24d821ab?mod=hp_lead_pos5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“Spiderweb”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; smuggled 117 drone weapons into Russia and unleashed them against several airfields on June 1, damaging or destroying dozens of Russian warplanes. The mission was months in the planning, the drones were smuggled on prefabricated cabins disguised as hunting lodges, and unsuspecting Russians were paid to drive the trucks that moved the cabins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Spiderweb” showcased Ukraine's special operations capabilities and was followed by more long-range sabotage.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;As &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/ukraine-attack-on-russian-oil&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, subsequent attacks targeted Russian refineries and other sites tied to the oil sector. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very impressive,” Balazs Jarabik, a former European Union diplomat and analyst for &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;RPolitik, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The energy-sector attacks, he said, were “making the Russian war effort more expensive, and creating shortages so the Russian people feel the pain of the war.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By year’s end, Ukraine had carried out an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-nearly-160-russian-oil-facilities-in-2025-sbu-says//?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;160 strikes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Russia’s oil sector – the campaign &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-reportedly-target-oil-infrastructure-in-siberia-over-2000-km-away-from-frontline/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reached&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as far as the Siberian city of Tyumen, some 1200 miles east of Moscow, and included &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-sbu-conducts-new-sea-baby-drone-strike-on-russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-in-black-sea-source-says/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;strikes against vessels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; alleged to be working in Russia’s so-called &quot;shadow fleet” of tankers carrying sanctioned oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ukraine’s theory of victory now includes destroying Russia’s energy sector,” Lt.

(Photo by Hassan Jedi/Anadolu via Getty Images)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Peace Deal for Gaza &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was President Trump’s signature diplomatic achievement: a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/article/guide-trumps-twenty-point-gaza-peace-deal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;truce in Gaza&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reached just days before the two-year anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023 massacre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal’s first phase took hold, albeit in violent fits and starts – the return of hostages, the freeing of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, and a fresh flow of international aid for Gaza. But that may have been the easy part. As the year drew to a close, there were sporadic breaks in the ceasefire, and the fate of the deal’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/whats-next-gaza-ceasefire-will-truce-last-2025-12-17/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;next phases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70155nked7o&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;plan for Gaza&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; included the deployment of an international stabilization force and creation of an international “Board of Peace” (led by Trump himself) to oversee the implementation of the next phases – the transition of governance to Palestinians not affiliated with Hamas, and the beginning of a multi-billion-dollar reconstruction. The deal also included language offering a conditional pathway to Palestinian autonomy over its territories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as of mid-December, the announcement of the Board had been delayed, and the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/13/world/middleeast/trump-gaza-plans-postwar.html?searchResultPosition=2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that while the U.S. was pressing other nations to contribute troops to a 8,000-member force for Gaza, it had yet to win any commitments. Countries were said to be worried their troops might be ensnared in fresh fighting; and the UN Security Council &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/world/middleeast/un-security-council-gaza-peace-plan.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;resolution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to deploy the force gave no precise terms of engagement. Nor was there agreement on the makeup of a transitional government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these hurdles appeared, reports suggested Hamas was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/world/middleeast/hamas-gaza.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;rebuilding its presence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the territory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Who’s really calling the shots there?” Ralph Goff, a former CIA Senior Executive, asked at &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; annual Threat Conference, speaking of the uncertainty inside Gaza&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;“I remain pretty pessimistic on the idea of any kind of internal governing force being able to compete with Hamas at this point.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By year’s end, two things were clear: the Gaza ceasefire itself was a welcome achievement after two years of carnage; and uncertainty hung over the truce’s critical next phases. This was one major story that will continue to unfold — with hope but also apprehension — well into 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;2556a&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=62282654&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The commissioning and flag-presenting ceremony of the Fujian, China's first aircraft carrier equipped with electromagnetic catapults, is held at a naval port in Sanya City, south China's Hainan Province, on Nov. 5, 2025.

It was a fitting symbol for a year in which China turbocharged its military buildup.&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/chinas-leap-forward-drone-weapons&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, China took a “leap forward” in drone weaponry in 2025: a huge new “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3336520/chinas-latest-stealth-endurance-drone-ch-7-completes-maiden-flight&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;stealth endurance drone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” mosquito-sized &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3315206/chinese-military-robotics-lab-creates-mosquito-sized-microdrone-covert-operations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“micro drones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” and the deployment of a new “&lt;a href=&quot;http://v&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;drone mothership&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” The latter, known as the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jiu Tian,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was billed as the world’s largest drone carrier – an 11-ton aircraft that is itself an uncrewed aerial vehicle. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3310879/china-extend-combat-range-uavs-jiu-tian-drone-carrier-prepares-first-mission?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;amp;pgtype=article&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jiu Tian &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;can hold 100 smaller UAVs and carry them more than 4,000 miles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They have the production, they have large inventory and now they also have the AI,” Dr. Michael Raska, a professor at the Military Transformation Programme at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/chinas-leap-forward-drone-weapons&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “With all these combined, they have been experiencing a leap forward in the quality and quantity of all their drones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China also made leaps in maritime power. In November, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.usni.org/2025/11/07/china-comissions-3rd-aircraft-carrier-fujian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;commissioned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the 80,000-ton &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fujian, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;the country’s third aircraft carrier and largest to date. A week later came &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.naval-technology.com/news/analysis-what-we-know-about-the-sichuan-chinas-drone-carrier-hybrid/?cf-view&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;news that&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sichuan, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;one of the world’s largest amphibious assault ships, would be ready for deployment next year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retired Rear Admiral Mike Studeman, a former Commander of the Office of Naval Intelligence,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/china-navy-fujian-sichuan&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;that China had achieved its longstanding goal of building “a world-class Navy,” which had surpassed the size of the U.S. fleet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's not just not in the numbers, it's in the quality,” RADM Studeman said. “These ships are modern by any standard.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's impressive,” another former Rear Admiral, Mark Montgomery, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/china-navy-fujian-sichuan&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “They're building a hundred merchant ships for every one we build, and two warships for every one we build.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump Administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-americas-maritime-dominance/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;issued&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an executive order in April to jumpstart the U.S. shipbuilding industry and restore “American maritime dominance,” but experts said the U.S. faces an uphill road. As &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reported, China is on track to have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/ship-wars-confronting-chinas-dual-use-shipbuilding-empire&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;425-ship fleet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by 2030, while the U.S. Navy currently has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/RL32665#:~:text=The%20Navy%20fell%20below%20300,included%20296%20battle%20force%20ships.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fewer than 300&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deployable battle-force vessels – a total which may drop as aging ships are retired faster than new ones are put to water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;6a855&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=62303368&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Police cars are seen on November 17, 2025 close to the railways that were damaged in an explosion on the rail line in Mika, next to Garwolin, central Poland, after the line presumably was targeted in a sabotage act. (Photo by Wojtek Radwanski/AFP via Getty Images)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Europe Wakes Up to the “Gray-Zone” War&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2025 was the year when Europe formally recognized – and began to respond to – a growing threat from the east: the so-called “gray-zone” war attributed to Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These attacks mushroomed in 2025 – from cyberattacks to railway bombings, the cutting of undersea cables to drone incursions into Poland and the Baltic states, and more. Experts said they were designed to be difficult to trace, and non-kinetic, so as not to draw a military response; as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-sabotage-shadow-war&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported, the Kremlin was likely “aiming to create disruption without triggering escalation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there were also signs that European leaders were waking up to the gravity of the threat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NATO’s Secretary General Mark Rutte &lt;a href=&quot;http://v&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;warned repeatedly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the dangers, and the alliance moved to improve detection and deterrence measures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nations took steps of their own. Finland &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/finland-steps-up-anti-drone-defences-amid-concerns-about-russia-2025-12-09/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;acquired&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of drone jammers and outfitted border forces with high-end drone detectors; leaders from Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltic states &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyivindependent.com/czech-president-pavel-says-europe-may-need-to-shoot-down-russian-aircraft-drones-violating-nato-airspace/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they might shoot down Russian aircraft if Moscow continued its provocations; in a September speech to the United Nations, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski went so far as to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/radoslaw-sikorski-poland-russia-un-security-council-nato/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;warn Moscow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “if another missile or aircraft enters our space without permission, deliberately or by mistake, and gets shot down and the wreckage falls on NATO territory, please don’t come here to whine about it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even nations far from the Russian frontier were waking up to the dangers; Ireland &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/ireland-unveils-euro-1-7-billion-plan-beef-up-weak-defenses/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;unveiled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a €1.7 billion, five-year defense plan that included systems to counter drones and protect undersea cables from Russian sabotage. And in her first public speech, MI6 chief Blaise Metreweli described the gray-zone threat bluntly: “The new frontline is everywhere,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/15/world/europe/uk-mi6-russia-chaos.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;she said. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;former Senior CIA Executive Dave Pitts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/gray-zone-warfare&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;stressed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the need “to change the risk calculation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to think of deterrence and response as a team sport - an Article 5 mindset,” Pitts wrote. “Gray-zone attacks that go unanswered reward our adversaries and reinforce the idea that there are more gains than risk…and encourage more attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p rel=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up for the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberinitiativesgroup.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Initiatives Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Sunday newsletter, delivering expert-level insights on the cyber and tech stories of the day – directly to your inbox.

(Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;America’s Rare Earth Crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, rare earth minerals rarely made global headlines. 2025 was the year when that changed. And for the U.S. government, it was also the year in which rare earths took center stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two basic facts underscored the urgency: rare earths are essential building blocks for everything from smart phones to home appliances to cars to all manner of military equipment and weapon systems; and China now produces an estimated 60 percent of the world’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-chinas-ban-rare-earths-processing-technology-exports-means?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; rare earths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and processes nearly 90 percent of them. The U.S. Geological Survey &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/the-pentagons-rare-earth-problem-is-a-china-problem-too&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that in 2024, the U.S. imported more than 95 percent of the total rare earths that it consumed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those realities spurred multiple U.S. efforts to change the dynamic: deals with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/10/united-states-australia-framework-for-securing-of-supply-in-the-mining-and-processing-of-critical-minerals-and-rare-earths/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Australia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://click.e.economist.com/?qs=9079e7399bd317c2cfd3baae3033852b32590721b7f84655629b584c1e3e5191c5d44d4d9a3bde9083dfde80ee777a3cf99b0b6186caf19ef2d67e88b1105cb9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Japan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; negotiations with other resource-rich countries, including Congo, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Malaysia; and threats to annex mineral-rich &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20251104-the-story-behind-the-scramble-for-greenlands-rare-earths&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greenland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Even the negotiations with Russia and Ukraine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/u-s-blueprint-to-rewire-economies-of-russia-ukraine-sets-off-clash-with-europe-72484515?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfc3gSk0w0_92NUFsVZbzbgo4gaQPaMc2Y5JEJEZTTWRCkSkSQ7wVFGFvuX8ek%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=694197a3&amp;amp;gaa_sig=I9naj79PLuhyrTwrEhQyujRt0p9ugV5-5PwrhmiUIh53v6S25ntaDcIPCdABYqFh_fi24bd9Gv7V-B-koPYV8w%3D%3D&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reportedly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; included plans for U.S. firms to invest in rare-earth extraction in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China’s imposition of rare-earth export &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-rare-earth-and-magnet-restrictions-threaten-us-defense-supply-chains&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;restrictions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; only heightened the concerns – and while those were lifted as part of a deal with Washington, the message was clear: China’s rare-earths dominance now poses a huge problem for the U.S., and gives China a powerful lever in any future negotiations with Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Miller, a Former Assistant Director of the CIA’s China Mission Center, called the rare earth access “vital” to U.S. technology and national security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We democracies must do more to assure we have continuous access to these metals, and we also need to start producing more,” Miller told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “All democracies must focus on this issue; we must act now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;Intel Chiefs Detail Top Threats \u2013 and Get a Grilling Over Signal Leak&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;bd782&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/intel-chiefs-detail-top-threats-u2013-and-get-a-grilling-over-signal-leak.jpg?id=60322271&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then-National Security Agency Director General Timothy Haugh, FBI Director Kash Patel, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe, and then-Defense Intelligence Agency Director Jeffrey Kruse appear during a Senate Committee on Intelligence Hearing on March 25, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Overhaul of the Intelligence Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before his return to the White House, Donald Trump promised to remake the U.S. intelligence community (IC). “We will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus,” Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/president-elect-trump-started-receiving-intelligence-briefings-rcna180834&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; soon after the 2024 election.“The departments and agencies that have been weaponized will be completely overhauled.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, it was a promise he kept. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were widespread cuts in staffing at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/trump-administration-to-cut-thousands-of-jobs-from-cia-and-other-spy-agencies-report?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the CIA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, FBI, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/03/11/trump-administration-halts-us-funding-for-two-cybersecurity-efforts-including-for-election?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;(CISA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the biggest reductions appeared to come at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which coordinates the 18 agencies of the IC. Roughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2025/08/20/odni_20_with_trumps_greenlight_gabbard_launches_historic_intelligence_overhaul__153198.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;40% of ODNI staff&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were cut, including the elimination or consolidation of the Foreign Malign Influence Center and some cyber threat units into other agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other high-level dismissals drew particular attention: National Intelligence Council acting head Mike Collins &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5298799-gabbard-fires-national-intelligence-council-leaders/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;was fired&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after presenting an assessment on Venezuela that contradicted the White House line; and NSA Director Gen. Timothy Haugh &lt;a href=&quot;https://defensescoop.com/2025/04/04/trump-fires-gen-timothy-haugh-cyber-command-nsa/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;lost his job&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after Trump “influencer” Laura Loomer questioned his loyalty to the administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending who you asked, the changes were a much-needed streamlining of a bloated intelligence apparatus; a reorganization to focus less on Russia and China and more on border security and drug trafficking; or a Trump-driven retaliation against institutions and individuals he had blamed for investigations or views with which he disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-level firings troubled several experts. Jon Darby, a longtime NSA veteran who served as director of operations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/abrupt-changes-at-the-top-of-the-national-security-agency-risk-destabilization&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; he was “very disheartened” by Gen. Haugh’s ouster. “We need an explanation of the underlying rationale,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beth Sanner, a &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; expert who served as Deputy Director for National Intelligence at ODNI, warned of a broader politicization of the IC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The intelligence community is not like asking people to hit the easy button and the ‘I agree with you’ button,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-presidents-daily-brief-no-assembly-required&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;she said.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “That's not our role. Our role is to say what we think and why we think it…The intelligence community isn't always right. But when done correctly and behind closed doors, I cannot understand why anybody would say that presenting an intelligence assessment that disagreed with policy needed to stop, or was an example of deep state. It's not. And it's really important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that said, the nature of the IC makes it difficult, even at the end of a tumultuous year for the various agencies, to know precisely what the impact of the “overhaul” has been – or will be in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; id=&quot;812fe&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=61620478&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fingers on laptop. (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Cybersecurity “Watershed” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed like a headline from a science fiction journal. An artificial intelligence system had conducted a large-scale espionage operation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t science fiction – or fake news. The AI giant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anthropic confirmed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the first real-world case of the use of an AI system to do exactly that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today marks a watershed in cybersecurity,” Jennifer Ewbank, a former Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency for Digital Innovation, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “AI has now crossed from tool to operator,” Ewbank said, “blurring the line between human intent and machine execution...a threshold has been crossed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic said that Chinese state-sponsored hackers had exploited its Claude AI system to carry out cyberattacks on corporations and foreign governments in September, and that the hackers had succeeded with only minimal human oversight. Anthropic’s threat intelligence chief &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the campaign had targeted about 30 entities, and represented a new level of AI-enabled hacking. The hackers posed as security auditors and successfully breached several systems, accessing privileged accounts and private data before being blocked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? The number of breaches and scale of the damage appeared small, and no U.S. government agencies were compromised. But the incident gave ammunition to doomsayers who have warned of AI nightmares – and showed that AI is already a valuable tool for hackers and state-backed cyber operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts called it the latest code-red warning for securing AI systems and deploying effective cyber defenses.

      <title>The Next Nuclear Proliferation Crisis Is Already Here</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/nuclear-proliferation-crisis</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly threatened that Russia might use nuclear weapons if its sovereignty or territory is threatened, as it enters the fourth year in its war of aggression in Ukraine. The Russian Federation has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2024-12/news/russia-revises-nuclear-use-doctrine&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;revised its nuclear doctrine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and lowered the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. And given the lethality of nuclear weapons, the use of nuclear weapons in any large-scale exchanges would kill tens or hundreds of millions of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1963 Cuban missile crisis brought us close to a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. It was the basis for President John F. Kennedy’s concern that more countries with nuclear weapons would create an unstable world with nuclear war more likely. President Kennedy feared that by 1970 there may be 10 nuclear powers instead of the four – the U.S. Soviet Union, United Kingdom and France – and by 1975 there could be as many as 10 or 20 nuclear weapons states. It would be “the greatest possible danger and hazard to contemplate – a nuclear arms race on a multipolar basis.” President Kennedy’s concerns are the concerns &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/nuclear-golden-dome-missile-defense&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;we have today&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with the prospect of a nuclear arms race in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/will-anything-stop-iran-s-pursuit-of-nuclear-weapons&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Middle East&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/north-korea&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;East Asia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cuban missile crisis contributed to several arms control efforts, like the Limited Test Ban Treaty (1963) banning atmospheric and underwater tests and the creation of the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Indeed, the NPT established a global framework for the 190-member counties to stop non-nuclear states from getting nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are now nine nuclear weapons states and concern that more countries will seek the resources necessary to produce their own nuclear weapons or to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In East Asia, North Korea has increased its stockpile of nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles to deliver these weapons of mass destruction. The Korea Institute for Defense Analysis recently publicly stated that North Korea has between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10625110&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;127 and 150 nuclear weapons&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and by 2030 they will have 200 nuclear weapons. And given the likely assistance North Korea is receiving from Russia with its nuclear and missile programs, it’s possible that South Korea and Japan, threatened by a belligerent North Korea, will conclude that they need their own nuclear deterrent programs, rather than relying on U.S. extended nuclear deterrence commitments. Indeed, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/seventy-one-percent-south-koreans-now-support-return-nuclear-weapons-their-country-even&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;recent poll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in South Korea had over 70% of the people saying they needed their own nuclear weapons program, rather than relying on the U.S. nuclear umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons for security assurances that Russia ignored. Will the U.S. and NATO be there for Ukraine this time, or should Ukraine pursue its own nuclear deterrent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bombing of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts-assess-strikes-response-and-what-comes-next&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iranian nuclear sites&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz in June 2025 was in response to Iran’s continued enrichment of uranium at 60% or higher and Iran’s unwillingness to permit International Atomic Energy Agency monitors to inspect nondeclared suspect enrichment sites. Thus since 2003, when Iran said they ceased their nuclear weapons program, Iran has been a threshold nuclear weapons state, months away from being able to produce nuclear weapons if the U.S. and the European Union didn’t comply with Iran’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this reality, and if Iran produces or acquires nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt would rush to create their own nuclear weapons programs. The June 2025 U.S. bombing of these nuclear sites in Iran was an effort to ensure that Iran did not go nuclear, with the likelihood that these countries would also establish their own nuclear deterrent programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Kennedy’s expressed concerns about a nuclear arms race during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 was prophetic. Sixty-three later, there is real concern by a few non-nuclear-weapon states that they would need their own nuclear weapons to address the nuclear threat from North Korea and Iran, and the rhetoric from Mr. Putin and Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Security Council, who warned that Russia is prepared to use nuclear weapons if it faces defeat in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column by Cipher Brief Expert Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was first published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/dec/10/cuban-missile-crisis-lessons-forgotten-nuclear-arms-race-spreads/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <title>What Would Follow a Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation?</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/muslim-brotherhood-terrorist-designation-trump</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/amman-jordan-april-23-jordanian-police-close-the-entrance-of-a-muslim-brotherhood-headquarter-after-the-announcement-of-bann.jpg?id=62600396&amp;amp;width=1200&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;coordinates=33%2C0%2C34%2C0&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP DIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;On November 24, 2025, President Trump&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/designation-of-certain-muslim-brotherhood-chapters-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations-and-specially-designated-global-terrorists/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;launched&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a process to designate Muslim Brotherhood chapters in Lebanon, Egypt, and Jordan as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) and Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing fresh intelligence that these specific affiliates provided material support to Hamas after the October 7 attacks on Israel, the White House gave Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent a tight 30-day deadline to produce a formal report. The goal, administration sources say, is to sever the financial arteries — from charitable fronts to hawala networks — that have kept the Brotherhood’s regional machinery alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision comes at a moment when the Brotherhood’s once carefully cultivated image as the respectable face of political Islam lies in tatters. Days before Trump’s executive order, Texas Governor Greg Abbott made his state&lt;a href=&quot;https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-designates-muslim-brotherhood-cair-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;the first&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to label both the Muslim Brotherhood and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) as terrorist entities, vowing to target what he called “radical extremists.” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/florida-gov-ron-desantis-cair-muslim-brotherhood-foreign-terrorist-organizations/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;followed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the move by Texas with his own similar executive order. With federal momentum now behind him, the designations threatens to cascade across the region—and potentially beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hamas was founded as the Egyptian arm of the Muslim Brotherhood and has made this very clear in its Charter of 1987,” Hans-Jakob Schindler, Senior Director of the Counter Extremism Project, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “The political statement of Hamas of 2017 did not mention this link specifically, but it also did not state that Hamas would be independent. Hence, Hamas remains part of the Muslim Brotherhood network.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roots of a Transnational Shadow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To grasp the stakes, the story must begin in Ismailia, Egypt, in 1928, when schoolteacher Hassan al-Banna founded the Ikhwan al-Muslimin as a movement of Islamic revival and social reform. What started with Quranic lessons and charity work exploded into a mass organization of hundreds of thousands by the 1940s, complete with a secret paramilitary wing, the Special Apparatus, that carried out bombings and assassinations against British forces and Jewish targets. Egypt banned the group in 1948; al-Banna was assassinated shortly afterward, almost certainly by state security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy-handed crackdowns, periods of accommodation, and notable ideological shifts have defined the Brotherhood’s trajectory since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officially, the Brotherhood renounced violence in the 1970s, and it built an unrivaled network of mosques, clinics, schools, and labor unions. The 2011 Arab Spring briefly catapulted it to power: Mohamed Morsi became Egypt’s first elected president in 2012. Fourteen months later, mass protests and a military coup ended the experiment. Egypt declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization in 2013, killed more than 1,000 supporters in a single day at Rabaa Square, and imprisoned tens of thousands more. Exiled, splintered, and radicalized,&lt;a href=&quot;https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/mappingmilitants/profiles/muslim-brotherhood&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;remnants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; went underground or looked to Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernando Caravajal, executive director at The American Center for South Yemen Studies and an expert in Sudanese affairs, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that the Brotherhood’s ideological flexibility allows it to reemerge in power vacuums, but cautions that the potential United States terrorist designation likely stems from outside interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Notice the timing: these statements came a week after the meeting with Saudi,” he said. “It wasn’t announced during the meeting, so we can’t say Saudis are openly pushing it, but they clearly have a hand behind it because of the timing, because of the content. It mentions Jordan and Lebanon — those are Saudi priorities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riyadh’s priorities center on containing Islamist movements and curbing Iranian influence in the Levant, making Jordan and Lebanon key arenas for Riyadh’s regional security strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the region, local chapters adapted in different ways. Jordan’s Islamic Action Front (IAF)&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/thousands-jordanians-rally-amman-support-hamas-2023-10-20/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;became&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the kingdom’s most organized opposition, running hospitals and schools and holding parliamentary seats. Lebanon’s looser network operates in Palestinian camps alongside Hezbollah. Both insist they are peaceful and gradualist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to understand that the relationship between the Muslim Brotherhood and violence is a tactical one,” Schindler said. “It can change at any point if the network feels that violence would be useful for its position and influence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past American attempts to&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/muslim-brotherhood-trump-terrorist-organization-designation-threat-rubio-11102260&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;designate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the entire Brotherhood collapsed amid pushback from Qatar, Turkey, and some European allies. This time, the White House has chosen a surgical strike. According to Schindler, the White House’s endeavor to focus on individual chapters is an optimal approach because it targets “chapters in countries that have themselves banned and/or designated the Muslim Brotherhood (Egypt, Jordan) and on Lebanon, where the distinction between Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas is hard to make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

In Lebanon, the most explicit public demonstration came when a Brotherhood-affiliated militia calling itself the al-Fajr Forces fired rockets into northern Israel days&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hamas&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;after&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Hamas’s massacre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hamas is the Muslim Brotherhood organization in Gaza and the West Bank. It calls itself such. However, it operates independently,” Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council and Former DHS Deputy Assistant Secretary for Counterterrorism Policy, Thomas Warrick, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Its revenues were derived from control of Gaza’s governance: taxes, donations from outside governments, and criminal activities from which it profited. Other MB chapters are small in budgets and manpower compared to Hamas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jordan, the IAF organized some of the largest pro-Hamas demonstrations in the Arab world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The clearest demonstrated ‘link’ between Hamas and the specified Muslim Brotherhood chapters is that a Brotherhood-affiliated group in Lebanon, al-Fajr Forces, launched rockets into Israel following the October 7 2023 Hamas terrorist attack,” Rose Kelanic, director of the Middle East Program at Defense Priorities, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, stressing that “the Muslim Brotherhood is not a terrorist threat to the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Egypt, underground networks — despite Sisi’s repression — funneled money and propaganda into Gaza. Yet Schindler specifically highlights Lebanon’s darker role in Hamas’s external operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;According to German court documents, the Hamas cell that was arrested in Germany and the Netherlands in December 2023, which had planned and prepared for terror attacks in Germany, was led by Hamas handlers in Lebanon,” he noted. “Given the close connection between Hamas and the wider Muslim Brotherhood network, it is therefore likely that such contacts also exist in Lebanon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real power of the designation, however, lies in America’s arsenal of financial warfare. Once listed, any bank worldwide that touches Brotherhood money in dollars risks losing access to the United States market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Disrupting the ability of large-scale extremist and terrorist networks, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, to have unhindered access to the global financial system is, of course, a very effective way to hinder their overall operations,” Schindler explained. “Hence, any country where this access is more restricted is, of course, a problem for such networks as it will increase their operational costs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; on YouTube?

Dependent on $1.5 billion in&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/RL33546&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;annual&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; U.S. aid and facing street fury over Gaza, King Abdullah II&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/jordan-outlaws-muslim-brotherhood-group-confiscates-its-assets-offices-2025-04-23/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;banned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the Brotherhood in April 2025 — yet the IAF still functions. While Schindler sees Washington’s possible move as reinforcement that will “aid in the efforts of the Jordanian government in countering Muslim Brotherhood structures in the country,” Kelanic warns of unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only scenario I worry about is if the U.S. insists on applying the FTO designation to the IAF, because that amounts to major meddling in Jordanian politics,” she noted. “The last thing the U.S. needs is another failed state in the Middle East.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey, experts point out, is perhaps the bigger headache. Schinder asserts that Turkey “is indeed an important network hub for Hamas,” in particular when it comes to the group’s financial systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Turkey is in a unique position to pressure Hamas to give up its weapons and power in Gaza and leave the Strip,” he continued. “Unfortunately, so far, the Turkish government does not seem to have done so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Warrick, “what Turkey will do in response to the U.S. designation is not yet clear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Supporting Muslim Brotherhood affiliates in the region is a core policy of the Turkish government, but President Erdoğan is mindful that his relationship with President Trump is strong and is valuable,” he explained. “The Turkish government is aware of the Trump administration’s hostile attitude towards the Muslim Brotherhood but is not likely to change its approach except in countries that the U.S. government has formally designated Brotherhood branches as Foreign Terrorist Organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior U.S. intelligence official, speaking to &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on background, described the administration’s delicate balancing act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The President comes out with a statement where he’s clearly trying not to offend the Qataris too much, but at the same time satisfying the UAE and the Saudis and the Egyptians,” the insider noted. “He’s riding the fence on this but skewing more to the anti-side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington is particularly wary of antagonizing Doha because Qatar remains a critical mediator with Islamist movements and an indispensable interlocutor in hostage, de-escalation, and regional crisis negotiations. The Qatar-based Brotherhood chapter formally disbanded in 1999, and Doha has repeatedly denied formal support for the Muslim Brotherhood, despite continued investigations&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.counterextremism.com/sites/default/files/country_pdf/QA-01082021.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;indicating&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the group’s ongoing financial backing and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hscentre.org/latest-articles/qatars-role-2023-2024-israel-hamas-war/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;praise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the likes of Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same insider predicted domestic ripple effects: “If we suddenly see a ton of states passing laws against the Brotherhood and CAIR, then we start to have some real domestic impacts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAIR has long faced allegations of historical ties to the Muslim Brotherhood because some of its early founders were&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/council-american-islamic-relations-cair&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;involved&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with U.S.-based organizations linked to Brotherhood-affiliated networks, and because it was named as an “unindicted co-conspirator” in the 2007 Holy Land Foundation case. Critics cite these associations as evidence of ideological or organizational overlap. However, no criminal charges were ever brought against CAIR, and no direct operational link to the Brotherhood has been proven. CAIR&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cair.com/dispelling-rumors-about-cair/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;denies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; any affiliation, and most of the evidence remains circumstantial, dated, and heavily disputed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also point out that Saudi Arabia and the UAE, both of which already list the Brotherhood as terrorists, are quietly celebrating. But not everyone agrees that an FTO designation is a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doing a blanket listing of ‘the Muslim Brotherhood’ is a huge risk for the U.S.,” Caravajal said. “It allows people to be arrested simply for going to the wrong mosque.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a movement that has survived bans, coups, and massacres for almost a century, this is only the latest test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problem with designating the Muslim Brotherhood is that it never was a unitary organization or even a franchise organization like Al-Qaeda or Da’esh,” Warrick added. “This is why the solution the Trump administration came up with is the correct one. By working with partners that have already outlawed or sanctioned the Muslim Brotherhood chapters in their countries, the U.S. government can work cooperatively with those countries. This approach also gives some clarity to people in those countries, which groups they need to avoid in order not to be sanctioned by OFAC.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In statistical terms, the coming year will offer a multi-modal distribution of possibilities: a plausible path of robust, AI-led growth sits in the middle, flanked by a productivity miracle on one side and a risk-laden, bond-market-led downside on the other. Investors and policymakers must prepare for all of these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Economics now recognizes the importance of institutions for growth, as evidenced by the winners of the Nobel Prize in economics for the last two years. And yet, the institutions that comprise innovation systems have become semi-fossilized in many countries, and policymakers rarely think about how to reform them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Anti-Semitism is a National Security Issue: It’s Time to Treat it Like One</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/antisemitism-national-security-priority</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT OPINION / PERSPECTIVE&lt;/strong&gt; -- Less than three months ago, two people were killed in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/terrorism-manchester&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;terrorist attack&lt;/a&gt; on Jewish people in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgregp43kko&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;synagogue in Manchester, UK&lt;/a&gt;, on the most solemn day of the Jewish religious calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days ago, a large crowd of Jewish people in Sydney, Australia, celebrated Hanukkah on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/12/15/bondi-beach-terror-attack-isis-philippines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bondi Beach&lt;/a&gt;. Two Islamic terrorists, father and son, fired at them from a nearby bridge. Sixteen innocent Jewish people were murdered, including a Holocaust survivor and a ten-year-old child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point of a terrorist attack is that even a relatively contained engagement spreads widespread fear. This is particularly the case with the Jewish community. The background for Jews is centuries of persecution culminating in the indescribable horror of the Holocaust. Even since then Jews for many years have lived in fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was friendly with an Israeli diplomat in Turkey thirty years ago. He could not travel in his own car, hopping around Istanbul instead by taxi (dangerous enough), and no one knew where he lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synagogues and Jewish schools in the UK have the sort of security I was used to in Kabul. There is even a charity trust, CST, dedicated purely to the security of Jewish people here. When a terrorist incident happens, most Jews ask themselves “Are we safe here?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, terrorism is working well against Jewish people and western governments need to show that they are serious about opposing terrorism. You can’t have a democracy when terrorism against one community is tolerated. Not least, because assuredly if we give up on the security of Jewish people others will be next. That is why anti-semitism must be seen as a national security imperative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the UK united against Islamic terrorism in the aftermath of the murder of 52 Londoners in 2005, we realised that it was not enough simply to pursue possible terrorists and to be prepared for possible attacks. We realised that we needed to understand and combat the hatred that drove these attacks and to stop it infecting vulnerable people who might be tempted by the Al-Qaeda message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What national security news are you missing today?

That was the message of British prime minister Keir Starmer. That is fine but the solution for Jewish people, as the terrorists know, is not about even more security systems around their synagogues and schools, about armoured cars transporting schoolkids around north London or about how safe it is to be publicly identifiable as Jewish. “Safety concerns” have been used to ban an Israeli football team from playing in Birmingham, and non-political Jewish entertainers from appearing in Edinburgh. Jews are likely to conclude that this is no life, and there must be safer places to live: and you have lost your battle against terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only solution to defeat this terror is declaring war on anti-semitism. Lots of people will tell me how difficult this would be. How do you distinguish “legitimate” criticism of Israel from criticism that uses conscious or unconscious anti-semitism? Couldn’t a state-backed campaign against anti-semitism have the opposite effect to the desired one, leading to even more isolation and hatred of the Jewish community?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are serious risks: no one is saying this is easy. But the status quo is no longer acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more mass casualty attack – let's say in some European or American city on Passover, 2026 – and the Jewish community is going to be packing its bags. And you have lost your battle against terrorism.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As AI moves from experimentation to real-world applications, the limits imposed by the physical world, capital markets, and political systems clearly matter more than its theoretical potential. Fortunately, such constraints are not hurdles to progress, but rather the scaffolding behind which it will take shape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
