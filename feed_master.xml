      <title>A European Solution for Germany’s China Challenge</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/merz-visit-to-china-must-demonstrate-european-unity-by-daniela-schwarzer-2026-02</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's upcoming visit to China comes at a pivotal moment. China's export prowess is driving a national debate about lagging competitiveness, and that debate is taking place alongside the European Union's efforts to devise a unified China strategy at a time when the United States appears increasingly unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Debt Restructuring Is Senegal’s Best Bet</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/senegal-should-pursue-debt-restructuring-as-soon-as-possible-by-abdoulaye-ndiaye-and-martin-kessler-2026-02</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Senegal does not have any pain-free options for escaping its intensifying debt crisis. But absent large volumes of cheap liquidity, attempting to repay its debts at all costs would likely prove costlier than biting the bullet and initiating debt-restructuring negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four years of grueling war have devastated Ukraine’s infrastructure, displaced millions of people, and pushed its economy to the brink. But sound policy, a surge in defense spending, sustained international aid, and restored air and sea access have stabilized demand and brought GDP close to prewar levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evelyn Farkas on Alliances, Ukraine, and China’s Growing Challenge</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/evelyn-farkas-on-alliances-ukraine-and-chinas-growing-challenge</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT INTERVIEW —&lt;/strong&gt; Evelyn Farkas has spent decades working at the center of U.S. national security and transatlantic defense policy. A former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, she now serves as Executive Director of the McCain Institute, where she focuses on strengthening democratic alliances and confronting authoritarian threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farkas spoke with The Cipher Brief’s Suzanne Kelly from the Munich Security Conference, where global leaders gathered amid continued war in Ukraine, uncertainty about U.S. commitments abroad, and growing concern over China’s long-term ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are highlights from the conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;expert-block-container expert-list&quot;&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;expert-original-about&quot;&gt;
          Dr. Evelyn N. Farkas is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, and served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia/Ukraine/Eurasia from 2012 to November 2015 and as Executive Director of the Graham-Talent WMD Commission. 
    	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE INTERVIEW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly: With everything going on right now from the Middle East to Ukraine to technology and AI and how that’s going to impact global security overall, what is top of mind for you there in Munich?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farkas:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it’s the state of the transatlantic alliance and then beyond that really all U.S. alliances. For me, that’s the thing that matters most. And I think that’s what Europeans and others, even those outside of Europe, especially our Asian allies, are going to be listening for. Are we still united?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly: Secretary Marco Rubio is expected to deliver a message here. What are you hoping to hear from him?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farkas:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m hoping he gives a speech more like the one Secretary Gates gave when he was exhorting Europeans to do more to carry the burden of our collective defense. Obviously now it’s urgent. Russia is conducting kinetic attacks on European territory every week. Europeans need to step up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beyond that, I hope he reasserts the U.S. commitment to the alliance because it’s in the U.S. interest. It undergirds our way of life, our democracy, our security, and our economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly: Are you seeing any shift in how Europeans are thinking about the alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farkas:&lt;/strong&gt; I think there’s a bifurcation. The working-level cooperation is still happening. We’re all working together, whether in government or out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, Europeans are much more distrustful of America. They’re not sure whether they can rely on us, and they don’t understand why our president has taken an approach that has at times been quite hostile rhetorically toward the allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly: How are you thinking about the Russia-Ukraine war from Munich?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farkas:&lt;/strong&gt; Everything depends on us getting this right, meaning the world community. The Ukrainians are fighting and will continue to fight. They have won this war strategically—it’s just a question of when and at what cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia cannot conquer and rule Ukraine. They’re weak economically and politically. Their military machine is being squeezed and needs to be squeezed more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need increased sanctions on Russia, but we also need to sanction China more because China is allowing Russia to continue the war, not just by buying oil but by providing technological dual-use capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly: How is Europe thinking about China?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farkas:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m a little bit concerned. The Japanese have taken a very strong approach. They’re maintaining deterrence and not pretending they share values with China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in Europe, we’re seeing leaders travel to Beijing and hedge. Europeans need to be careful because China is not their friend. China will eat their lunch in a minute, and China is not a democracy. You don’t want to be aligned with that kind of government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly: Looking ahead, what are the most critical issues to get right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farkas:&lt;/strong&gt; The most important thing is helping Ukraine bring the message home to the Russian elite and the Russian people that they cannot win militarily and that Ukraine will maintain its sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deterring China is equally important. China is pushing the envelope, and we need to maintain our strength against both adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly: Final thoughts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farkas:&lt;/strong&gt; We must help Ukraine win and maintain sovereignty, and we must deter China. Those are the defining strategic challenges right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert insights into national security in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, still wanted by American authorities on a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/dispatches/next-steps-to-secure-venezuelas-democratic-future/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;$25&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; million bounty for narco-terrorism charges, controls Venezuela’s coercive forces and armed collectives. His role in coordinating political prisoner releases illustrates the paradox of the current transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foro Penal, Venezuela’s leading human rights organization that has provided pro bono legal assistance to victims of arbitrary detention since 2002, estimates that approximately&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_political_prisoner_release_in_Venezuela&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;711&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; political prisoners are detained as of mid-February. Releases often come with severe restrictions. When opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa was&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/08/americas/venezuela-political-prisoners-opposition-released-latam-intl&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;freed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on February 8 after eight&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/08/americas/venezuela-political-prisoners-opposition-released-latam-intl&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;months&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of detention, armed men abducted him hours later. He is now under house arrest with an ankle monitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were released, they reunited with their families, until the enlightened stupidity of some politicians led them to believe they could do whatever they wanted and stir up trouble in the country,” Cabello&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2026/02/10/venezuelan-thug-chief-diosdado-cabello-defends-abduction-freed-political-prisoner/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;stated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after Guanipa’s re-arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luis Bustos, the Bogotá-based spokesperson for the Venezuelan opposition party Primero Justicia, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that his party alone has 61 members imprisoned as political prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is still a high risk of getting arrested if authorities are aware that you are happy about the situation,” Bustos continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Caracas and popular zones, armed collectives demonstrate the regime’s ability to maintain social control outside of formal state structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After Maduro’s arrest, a circular went out saying that opposition supporters would be captured and obviously alluding to actions of justice by these groups,” Vaquero insists. “So repression itself has not diminished, not in a constant way, not in a sustainable way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elections: A Constitutional Impossibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan opposition figures and Washington officials increasingly acknowledge that legitimate elections cannot take place in the near term. The electoral system’s corruption under Chavismo extends beyond fraudulent vote counting to fundamental issues of voter registry manipulation and military involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This government put deceased people to vote,” Vaquero claims. “This government gave identity cards indiscriminately to Cubans, to Russians, to Chinese, to people from FARC, to people from ELN.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;María Corina Machado, the Nobel Peace Prize&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/08/americas/venezuela-political-prisoners-opposition-released-latam-intl&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;laureate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; leading Venezuela’s unified opposition, estimated in early February that transparent elections using manual voting could take place within 9 to 10&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wlrn.org/2026-02-13/nbc-news-venezuelan-president-delcy-rodriguez-pledges-free-and-fair-elections-but-no-future-date&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;months&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez, Delcy’s brother and key regime interlocutor with Washington,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2026/02/10/latam-venezuela-elelctions-later/1371770749886/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;ruled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; out elections in the near future, citing the need for stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

When pressed on when elections might be held, Leavitt stated: “It’s too premature and too early to dictate a timetable for elections in Venezuela right now.” She emphasized that the administration has “maximum leverage over the interim authorities in Venezuela,” and that “their decisions are going to continue to be dictated by the United States of America.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The constitutional framework technically allows Acting President Rodríguez to serve 90 days, with a possible ninety-day extension if approved by the Chavista-controlled National&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/dispatches/next-steps-to-secure-venezuelas-democratic-future/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Assembly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Temporary absence provisions, however, are interpreted creatively by the Supreme Court, which effectively eliminates any firm deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. intelligence official focused on Latin America issues, speaking on background to &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, estimates that credible elections extend well beyond constitutional requirements. The source highlights that comprehensive electoral reform requires dismantling power structures that are still firmly entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bustos also underscores that elections might realistically occur as early as next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need first of all to get a country more stable,” he says. “We need to put our institutions on stronger foundations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without functioning democratic institutions, independent electoral authorities, or international oversight mechanisms in place, any rushed election would ratify the status quo. Under current conditions, elections would not be free or fair because the regime controls voters’ registries and ballots. As long as the same power structure is still in place, cosmetic reforms cannot address this fundamental barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage and Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these obstacles, the Trump administration can drive genuine change by maintaining pressure through its military presence and negotiations over sanctions relief. It appears, however, that the regime is trying to outlast Washington’s attention by complying tactically with American demands while maintaining fundamental power structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paola Salazar, director for Medellín and Antioquia state at Colombia’s government migration agency, Migración Colombia, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that pendular migratory flows between Colombia and Venezuela have&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/5/delcy-rodriguez-sworn-in-as-venezuelas-president-after-maduro-abduction&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;remained&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stable since January 3, suggesting Venezuelans are not yet convinced conditions have fundamentally changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Alejandro Méndez Hernández, a Venezuelan community organizer in Bogotá, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that trust is still absent, hence migrants are not returning despite Maduro’s removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a huge amount of Venezuelans being arrested as political prisoners, who haven’t been released until today, so it’s not building trust,” he continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acting President Rodríguez&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wlrn.org/2026-02-13/nbc-news-venezuelan-president-delcy-rodriguez-pledges-free-and-fair-elections-but-no-future-date&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; NBC News earlier this month that she would hold free and fair elections but declined to commit to a timeline, stating that the schedule would be determined through political dialogue. When pressed about Machado, Rodríguez said she would face legal scrutiny upon any return for calling for military intervention and sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio has publicly outlined a three-phase approach for Venezuela’s future — stability, recovery, and transition to democracy — though he has declined to provide a specific timeline. During his January 28 Senate Foreign Relations Committee testimony, Rubio emphasized that “the end state here is we want a friendly, stable, prosperous Venezuela, and democratic, in which all elements of society are represented in free and fair elections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Rubio acknowledged the complexity of the timeline, stating, “We’re not going to get there in three weeks. It’s going to take some time.” In subsequent remarks to reporters, he added that the transition “can’t take forever” and acknowledged there must be progress within several months. However, he cautioned that “this is not a campaign to leave in place the systems currently in place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Diosdado Factor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interior Minister Cabello represents the most significant obstacle to a genuine transition. With control over security forces, intelligence services, and armed collectives, he possesses the coercive apparatus necessary to maintain regime control independent of formal governmental structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diosdado Cabello has a price imposed by the United States,” Vaquero explains. “He controls the coercive apparatus and all the internal loyalties. We’ve seen him lately. Every time he appears in Venezuelan media, he looks scared.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. intelligence source identifies Cabello as the key figure whose removal or neutralization would be necessary for an authentic democratic opening. As long as Cabello maintains control of security forces, any political transition will be cosmetic rather than substantive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His control extends beyond formal military and police to encompass armed civilian collectives that intimidate opposition supporters and maintain social control, operating with impunity while allowing the regime to claim official restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Influence and Regional Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regime’s historical relationships with Iran, Hezbollah, Russia, and China complicate transition planning. Despite keeping a low profile after Maduro’s removal, these actors continue to threaten American national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bustos stresses that the presence of Hezbollah and Iranian-linked entities necessitates an extended transition period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The United States certainly knows about it,” he says. “I think that it’s not possible to get them out of the country really quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The re-extradition of Colombian-Venezuelan businessman Alex Saab in early&lt;a href=&quot;https://colombiaone.com/2026/02/04/fbi-arrests-alex-saab-maduro-venezuela/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;February&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, designated by the United States as a key financial operator for Maduro, demonstrates some cooperation from regime elements with American law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saab’s arrest represents a significant test of cooperation with Washington. U.S. authorities accused Saab of moving approximately&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Saab&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;$350&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; million out of Venezuela through corrupt contracts, making him central to understanding how the regime financed itself under sanctions. His potential extradition signals Rodríguez is willing to sacrifice even Maduro’s closest financial operatives to maintain Washington’s support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 9&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2026/2/4/these-exiled-venezuelans-dream-of-returning-home-whats-stopping-them&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Venezuelans in the diaspora are reassessing their return prospects, yet few are making immediate plans to return. The combination of continued repression, economic uncertainty, and the presence of the same officials who forced their exile creates a wait-and-see dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan passports cost approximately&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2026/2/4/these-exiled-venezuelans-dream-of-returning-home-whats-stopping-them&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;$700&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the black market when available, complicating both legal status abroad and potential return. Embassies and consulates are largely non-functional, creating a documentation crisis that traps Venezuelans in limbo regardless of whether they wish to return home or establish permanent residence elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a fundamental question for Washington intelligence planners: Does the current arrangement represent a genuine transition, or is it simply the regime’s survival under American pressure? Continuing imprisonment of opposition figures and constitutional maneuvers to avoid elections suggest the former.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official from the U.S. intelligence community notes the regime is maintaining strategic control while ensuring tactical compliance. In the absence of sustained military and economic pressure and clear benchmarks, the current government will likely continue to drag its feet on reforms for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prisoner release pattern is illustrative. While&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_political_prisoner_release_in_Venezuela&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;hundreds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have been freed, the process is opaque, reversible, and controlled entirely by Cabello’s interior ministry. As well as gag orders, those released are subject to re-arrest for hypothetical “political activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino’s presentation of a golden baton to Rodríguez at a military&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wunc.org/2026-02-05/venezuelas-interim-leader-works-to-balance-u-s-demands-and-chavista-expectations&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;parade&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in February symbolized the armed forces’ continued allegiance to Chavista structures rather than any new democratic order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela’s situation tests the Trump administration’s approach to authoritarian transitions. Government policy toward Venezuela currently reflects a calculated preference for energy security over democratic reform. Washington views maintaining regional stability and securing oil access as more pressing strategic priorities than the unpredictable outcomes of rapid political reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s stated objectives for Venezuela emphasize democratic transition. Rubio&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/01/secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-before-the-senate-committee-on-foreign-relations-on-u-s-policy-towards-venezuela&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;told the Senate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Washington seeks “free and fair elections” where “all elements of society are represented,” noting pointedly that “you can have elections all day,” but without media access for opposition and the ability for opposition candidates to run freely, “those aren’t free and fair elections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the administration’s actions reveal a calculated preference for energy security over rapid political reform. In the same testimony, Rubio prioritized Venezuela becoming “a friendly, stable, prosperous” partner and ending threats from “Hezbollah and Iran in our own hemisphere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington views maintaining regional stability and securing oil access as more pressing strategic priorities than the unpredictable outcomes of immediate democratic reforms. This pragmatism risks legitimizing a rebranded authoritarianism, retaining the repressive mechanisms of Maduro’s regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, observers caution that this pragmatism may come at a cost in the long run. By prioritizing energy and migration management, the U.S. risks legitimizing a rebranded authoritarianism that retains the repressive mechanisms of Maduro’s regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela James Story&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wunc.org/2026-02-05/venezuelas-interim-leader-works-to-balance-u-s-demands-and-chavista-expectations&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;assessed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Rodríguez will play for time, doing “just enough to make it look as if they are complying” while waiting for U.S. focus to shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela’s post-Maduro transition ultimately reveals limitations of decapitation strategies against entrenched authoritarian systems. While removing Maduro eliminated the regime’s symbolic figurehead, the intelligence and security apparatus is intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elections cannot occur in the short term, at least not elections meeting minimal standards of freedom and fairness. There is corruption in the electoral infrastructure, arrests of opposition figures for political activities, and the ability and leadership of those who would suppress genuine democratic opening is intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the current arrangement provides tactical benefits, it also leaves strategic vulnerabilities regarding oil access and preventing a migration surge. The same figures wanted on U.S. criminal charges coordinate government functions. The same security services that tortured political prisoners manage their conditional release. The same armed collectives that intimidated voters patrol neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where Diosdado Cabello has been, obviously repression has not disappeared,” Vaquero adds. “It materializes with collectives, with social pressure, with selective judicialization. And obviously, while Diosdado remains in power, there won’t be profound change but rather tactical changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump and his acolytes have long promoted the narrative that the European Union is weak and misguided, and there was no let-up at the World Economic Forum’s annual gathering Davos in January or at this month’s Munich Security Conference. But the truth is that Europe’s social-market model and commitment to openness continue to pay dividends. Far from doubting itself, the EU should double down on its strengths and, as the US-China geopolitical rivalry heats up, tout them as an example for the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump’s Venezuela strategy prioritizes oil reconstruction over elections, treating democracy as an afterthought. But without credible institutions and political legitimacy, Venezuela cannot attract the private capital needed to rebuild its oil sector or provide the legal certainty long-term projects demand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By repealing the &quot;endangerment finding&quot; that required US authorities to consider the societal costs of greenhouse-gas emissions, the Trump administration has further reduced the regulatory burden on US banks relative to their peers.

      <title>Turkey’s Lawfare Is a Warning</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/erdogan-detention-of-ekrem-imamoglu-turkey-shows-dangers-of-lawfare-by-bilal-bilici-and-eric-a-baldwin-2026-02</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The detention of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu in Turkey is a classic example of democratic backsliding.

But that does not mean it will all be smooth sailing ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a country as large and diverse as the United States, expanding economic opportunity cannot and should not depend on volatile federal policies. A framework of directed improvisation that aligns federal and state priorities with local capacities offers a promising way to promote broad-based development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Defending the Homeland: Pentagon Shifts Strategy on Drone Threats</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/defending-the-homeland-pentagon-shifts-strategy-on-drone-threats</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;“This memorandum consolidates approximately ten separate outdated memoranda that were inadequate to address the current, complex unmanned aircraft system (UAS) threat environment. The new guidance affects a culture shift by empowering commanders to unambiguously apply their authority to mitigate threat UAS. Our message is clear, Department of War (DoW) airspace is off limits, and our commanders on the ground have the discretion to defend our airspace against all manner of UAS threats…Expanding the Defensive Perimeter : Grants commanders the authority to extend defensive actions beyond the physical ‘fence line’ of an installation; allows for the adequate protection of covered facilities, fixed assets, and mobile assets; placing trust in the commander and maximizing their flexibility to defend facilities and assets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a quote from last Tuesday’s Defense Department (DoD) press release, &lt;em&gt;Fact Sheet: C-UAS [counter unmanned aircraft systems] Policy in the U.S. Homeland&lt;/em&gt;. It was issued just hours before the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) temporarily closed airspace within an 11-mile radius of El Paso International Airport, but after Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel on the day before [Monday, February 9] used a classified Pentagon laser system on nearby Fort Bliss Air Base, to shoot down what they thought were drug cartel UAS systems [drones], but turned out to be metallic party balloons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last month had approved lending the 20-kilowatt directed-energy LOCUST [laser] weapon to CBP for use on the Fort Bliss installation, whose fence line is on the Mexican border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CBP test was not coordinated with the FAA and the resultant uproar, which subsequently involved the White House and Congress, marks only the beginning of what I believe will be a series of similar episodes related to homeland protection against suspect UAS drone systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interesting sidelight to last week’s events: The Senate Armed Services Committee was scheduled to have a meeting last Thursday morning with two Pentagon drone experts, Owen O. West, DoD&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Senior Advisor for Drone Dominance, and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Travis Metz, Drone Dominance Program Manager. It was called off at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What national security news are you missing today?

There are strict FAA rules that govern drones over 55 pounds or any flown for non-recreational purposes. There are even some FAA requirements for outdoor flying of smaller drones for personal pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back on June 6, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) called Restoring American Airspace Sovereignty that dealt primarily with UAS. It said of them, “criminals,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;terrorists, and hostile foreign actors have intensified their weaponization of these technologies, creating new and serious threats to our homeland. Drug cartels use UAS to smuggle fentanyl across our borders, deliver contraband into prisons, surveil law enforcement, and otherwise endanger the public. Mass gatherings are vulnerable to disruptions and threats by unauthorized UAS flights. Critical infrastructure, including military bases, is subject to frequent — and often unidentified — UAS incursions. Immediate action is needed to ensure American sovereignty over its skies and that its airspace remains safe and secure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s June 2025 EO also said that the United States must have a secure and strong domestic UAS industrial base and that relying on UAS produced in foreign countries as well as foreign-made UAS critical components pose unacceptable national security risks to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one response, the June EO called for, “The Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense; the Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Administrator of the FAA; the Secretary of Homeland Security; the Director of OMB; and the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, shall promptly take all appropriate steps…with regard to the creation of the National Training Center for Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Center), and, upon establishment of the Center, focus initial training provided by the Center on development of Federal and SLTT [State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial] capabilities to secure major upcoming national and international sporting events held in the United States, such as the FIFA World Cup 2026 and the 2028 Summer Olympics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By December 2025, the FBI had established the National Counter-UAS Training Center (NCUTC) at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville Alabama where the Bureau already had cybersecurity, intelligence, and forensic training. Ever since, the NCUTC has been training officers from state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies on how to detect drones using radar, radio frequency sensors, and related technologies. More important, they are trained how to identify whether a drone is authorized or hostile, assess threats, and coordinate responses across various agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During training, the FBI emphasizes that offensive actions against drones only occur when legally authorized, but the rules are complex. The FAA website, to assist law enforcement personnel responding to drone incidents, has created a three-part video series that covers the basics of drone regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional response to the Trump June 2025 EO was Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s establishment in August 2025 of Joint Interagency Task Force 401 (JIATF 401) to replace the Pentagon’s then existing Joint C-sUAS Office. Operating under the Secretary of the Army, Hegseth’s order said, “JIATF 401 will be a joint activity and established as a jointly manned organization. The Military Services will support JIATF 401 with timely joint manning…This&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;new task force is empowered with broader authorities, funding flexibility, and rapid acquisition capabilities. Its mission is to strengthen U.S. airspace sovereignty, protect personnel and facilities, and outpace adversaries’ growing drone threats. With joint manning, interagency collaboration, and streamlined governance, JIATF 401 is designed to deliver innovative, mission-ready solutions at speed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example of cooperation, last Thursday, Army Brig. Gen. Matt Ross, JIATF 401 Director, visited the FBI's NCUTC in Huntsville yesterday. He met with Mike Torphy, FBI acting assistant section chief for UAS and counter-UAS, and discussed security preparations for this summer's soccer FIFA World Cup activities. Ross and Torphy also met with expert instructors who are teaching a specialized course for local law enforcement in each of the soccer tournament's eleven host cities across the nation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more unusual steps underway in the drone security field was announced by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) last December 21. It referred to “a [White House] National Security Determination regarding the unacceptable risks posed by UAS and UAS critical components that are produced in foreign countries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that, “U.S. cybersecurity and critical infrastructure guidance has repeatedly highlighted how foreign manufactured UAS can be used to harvest sensitive data, used to enable remote unauthorized access, or disabled at will via software updates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the FCC has updated its so-called Covered List, which identifies foreign-made communications equipment and services that pose unacceptable risks to U.S. national security, and thus cannot be imported for sale or use in the U.S. The action, taken by the FCC last December 22, prohibited the future imports of both foreign-made UAS and UAS components, but does not affect any previously-purchased drone, nor does it prevent retailers from continuing to sell, import, or market foreign drone models or parts approved earlier in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found one of the best descriptions of the drone security dilemma was in a sales brochure entitled &lt;em&gt;Countering UAV Threats&lt;/em&gt;, produced by BAE Systems, a leading defense contractor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BAE brochure said, “Detecting small and inexpensive UAVs remains one of the most persistent operational challenges facing today’s militaries. These platforms possess small radar cross-sections, produce minimal acoustic and thermal signatures, and often operate at low altitudes within ground clutter. Many are capable of autonomous flight with little or no radio frequency (RF) emission, making traditional detection methods unreliable. Urban and vegetated terrain further complicate detection, as buildings and foliage create blind spots and signal reflections that mask UAV movement. Adverse weather, restricted lines of sight and interference from birds or civilian activity introduce additional uncertainty.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then brochre went on, “A connected challenge is distinguishing between hostile and civilian UAVs. Attribution and intent are major challenges, as it is often unclear who controls a UAV and for what purpose it is being used, particularly in grey-zone or proxy scenarios. The compressed decision timelines of UAV operations further complicate matters, as engagements frequently occur in seconds, leaving little room for deliberation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needless to add, last week the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida awarded BAE a cost-plus-fixed-fee $145 million contract for the development, manufacturing, and delivery of Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems weapon systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with everything else, the drone problem is worth keeping an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who's reading this? 500K+ dedicated national security professionals.

      <title>How Cuba's Infrastructure Crisis Is Opening the Door to Foreign Intelligence Networks</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/how-cuba-s-infrastructure-crisis-is-opening-the-door-to-foreign-intelligence-networks</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/topshot-view-of-the-nico-lopez-oil-refinery-in-havana-cuba-on-february-12-2026-russia-is-expected-to-supply-cuba-with-oil.jpg?id=64944872&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C56%2C0%2C57&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP DIVE — &lt;/strong&gt;On February 13, nighttime light emissions across major Cuban cities had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2026-cuba-oil-supply-power-grid-blackout/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; as much as 50 percent compared to historical averages — the latest chapter in a crisis that has seen the island's grid collapse multiple times over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As desperate citizens in half the country waited in the dark, something else was accelerating along the island's few electrified corridors. Chinese technicians continued installing telecommunications equipment, Russian engineers maintained radar stations, and intelligence operatives from both nations embedded themselves deeper into Cuba's crumbling infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 90 miles from Florida, Cuba's energy crisis has metastasized from an economic catastrophe into a national security vulnerability. Although Havana struggles to maintain the lights, Beijing and Moscow have come to Cuba's aid not as charitable donors but as strategic opportunists seeking to expand their intelligence-collection capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department &lt;a href=&quot;https://cu.usembassy.gov/alert-increased-nationwide-power-outages-to-include-havana/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; just one day after the latest outage that &quot;scheduled power cuts occur daily, and unscheduled outages persist throughout Cuba.&quot; The island's thermoelectric plants, many dating back decades, now operate at barely &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/cuba-energy-crisis&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt; percent of their capacity. In February, five of eight Turkish-leased floating power &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.med-or.org/en/news/cuba-guarda-alla-cina-per-risolvere-la-crisi-energetica&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; departed Cuban ports after Havana failed to meet payment obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crisis has intensified dramatically as Cuba's oil lifelines have been severed. Following the U.S. seizure of control over Venezuelan oil operations in early January, Mexico had become Cuba's primary supplier, shipping nearly 20,000 barrels per day through September 2025. Yet, under mounting pressure from the Trump administration, which threatened tariffs on any country supplying Cuba with oil, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced in late January that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2026/01/28/nx-s1-5691086/mexico-oil-shipments-cuba&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shipments&lt;/a&gt; had been at least temporarily halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figure had already plummeted to about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mexico-cuba-trump-oil-tariff-9.7069046&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;7,000&lt;/a&gt; barrels per day, leaving Cuba essentially without oil imports for the first time in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakdown has created an opening that America's strategic competitors are exploiting with alarming sophistication. From this vantage point, intelligence services can monitor U.S. military installations across the Southeast, track Space Force &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-intelligence-footprint-cuba-new-evidence-and-implications-us-security&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;launches&lt;/a&gt; from Cape Canaveral, intercept communications from Southern Command headquarters in Florida, and observe naval movements throughout the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Beijing and Moscow, Cuba's desperation has become an important windfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beijing's Digital Footprint Expands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's presence in Cuba has grown exponentially, particularly in telecommunications and digital infrastructure. In testimony before Congress last May, national security analysts confirmed that satellite imagery identifies at least four Chinese-linked signals intelligence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/beijings-air-space-and-maritime-surveillance-cuba-growing-threat-homeland&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;facilities&lt;/a&gt; across Cuba — Bejucal, Wajay, and Calabazar near Havana, plus a newly constructed site at El Salao near Santiago de Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Cuba's proximity to the homeland continues to make the island an attractive intelligence platform for U.S. adversaries,&quot; Connor Pfeiffer, senior director of government relations at Foundation for the Defense of Democracies Action, tells &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;. &quot;Within 400 miles of Havana sit the headquarters of the U.S. combatant commands for Latin America and the Middle East, U.S. Special Operations Command, and air bases that regularly host advanced U.S. fighter aircraft.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

These companies aren't simply selling hardware; they're installing the very networks through which Cuba's limited internet traffic flows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because of this proximity, intelligence outposts in Cuba provide signals intelligence and other capabilities that are invaluable to Beijing and Moscow,&quot; Pfeiffer explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The El Salao site features a circularly disposed antenna array, a configuration highly effective at determining the origin and direction of incoming high-frequency signals. These installations can track signals up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2024/intell-240702-voa01.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;9,300&lt;/a&gt; miles, providing Beijing with unprecedented visibility into U.S. military communications and operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, home to U.S. Central Command and Special Operations Command, sits less than 300 miles from Cuban shores. Naval Station Mayport in Jacksonville, Naval Air Station Key West, and dozens of other sensitive military installations across Florida, Georgia, and Alabama all operate within easy range. The advantage over satellite surveillance is stark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;By contrast to what can be obtained from overhead satellite images and other collection from satellites in low earth orbit whose time passing overhead can be anticipated, the ELINT facilities in Cuba are a constant presence with line of sight to key U.S. facilities,&quot; Evan Ellis, research professor of Latin American Studies at the U.S. Army War College Strategic Studies Institute, tells &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure crisis has made Cuba more dependent on Chinese technical expertise. In February 2025, Chinese Ambassador Hua Xin and Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel announced China would construct 55 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.med-or.org/en/news/cuba-guarda-alla-cina-per-risolvere-la-crisi-energetica&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;solar&lt;/a&gt; plants by the end of 2025, with an additional 37 planned by 2028. If completed, the network would add over 2,000 megawatts of capacity. However, this dependency gives Chinese intelligence services unprecedented access to Cuban government communications, military installations, and infrastructure systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;During the present U.S. military operations in the Caribbean, and in a future U.S. conflict in the Indopacific involving U.S. deployment from bases on the Atlantic seaboard and transit through the Caribbean, the Chinese electronic intelligence gathering facilities in Cuba are well positioned to capture not only things like radio transmissions, but the emissions from U.S. facilities, and the signatures of U.S. ships and other forces,&quot; Ellis underscores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms: China's Cuban listening posts can intercept not just what U.S. forces communicate, but the electronic fingerprints of their equipment, from radar emissions to communications arrays and ship propulsion systems. By using these signatures, adversaries can identify specific vessels and aircraft, track their movements, and potentially develop countermeasures to defeat U.S. military technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moscow's Renewed Military Presence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's intelligence footprint in Cuba never entirely disappeared after the Cold War, yet Moscow's activities have intensified dramatically. In March 2025, Russia and Cuba signed a military &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.kremlin.ru/acts/news/78222&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cooperation&lt;/a&gt; agreement that Russian lawmakers ratified in October. Ukrainian intelligence estimates that between 6,000 and 7,000 Cubans are currently fighting as mercenaries in Russia's war against Ukraine — the second-largest foreign contingent after North Korea's approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2025/10/30/ukraine-closes-havana-embassy-over-cuban-fighter-pipeline-for-russia/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;12,000&lt;/a&gt; troops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than operating out of a single massive facility like the Soviet-era Lourdes complex, Russian intelligence has embedded personnel and equipment within ostensibly civilian infrastructure projects. Russian engineers arrive whenever Cuba's power grid requires emergency maintenance, bringing more than just technical skills. When radar systems at Cuban air defense installations fail, Russian specialists provide upgrades with built-in collection capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has also leveraged Cuba's energy crisis to deepen military cooperation through increasingly frequent naval port calls in Havana; visits that allow Russian intelligence personnel to rotate in and out without scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone in the intelligence community shares the alarm. Critics argue the threat is being overblown by voices eager to justify increased defense spending or maintain hardline Cuba policies that have failed for six decades. Some policy experts argue the infrastructure crisis actually presents an opportunity. If Washington eased sanctions and provided assistance to Cuba's energy sector, Havana would have less incentive to accommodate Chinese and Russian intelligence requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Ellis rejects the notion that Cuba could credibly reduce its ties to Beijing and Moscow in exchange for U.S. economic relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Although U.S. economic coercion, taking advantage of Diaz-Canel's currently desperate economic state, could facilitate a deal in which Cuba promises to reduce its Cuban or Russian presence, Cuba will promise to comply to the degree that it can without truly breaking those ties to China and Russia, which for it are both ideological allies and partners in its survival,&quot; he continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regime's dependency, Ellis stresses, runs too deep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not until there is a sincerely democratic pro-US regime in Cuba will the U.S. be truly secure from the type of extra-hemispheric threats that Cuba, like Venezuela, can host in the Caribbean,&quot; he asserts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The desperation-dependence cycle gives Beijing and Moscow leverage that extends beyond traditional espionage. Cuban officials are not in a position to demand transparency when Chinese technicians install new telecommunications equipment. Moreover, when Russian engineers service radar installations in Havana, the government lacks leverage to refuse requests for expanded intelligence cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Without Venezuelan oil aid, the Cuban regime faces acute energy shortages and reduced inflows of much-needed foreign currency,&quot; Pfeiffer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's successful pressure on Mexico to halt oil shipments represents a calculated gamble—one that leverages Mexico's vulnerability during upcoming trade agreement negotiations. The complete severance could accelerate the regime's collapse—or drive it even more desperately into Chinese and Russian arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intelligence implications extend far beyond passive eavesdropping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The data that could be collected could allow the Chinese to capture particular intelligence transmitted in an imperfectly secure or decipherable fashion, but also just from the signatures, have an idea regarding the composition and state of activity of U.S. forces, their location, and signatures that could allow them to more effectively locate and defeat U.S. systems in combat,&quot; Ellis points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst-case scenarios involve cyber weapons pre-positioned in critical infrastructure, electronic warfare systems that could interfere with U.S. military communications during a crisis, or intelligence networks that could support hostile operations on America’s doorstep. The geographic proximity compounds every vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet not everyone views American intervention as the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leon Valencia, a former ELN rebel commander and director of the Bogota-based think tank Fundación Paz y Reconciliación, offers a Colombian perspective that reflects broader Latin American sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We do see Cuba more as a victim,&quot; Valencia tells &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;. &quot;Throughout several peace negotiations, Cuba has been a very important part. For example, the peace agreements with the FARC rebels, signed back in 2016, were negotiated in Cuba. Cuba has always kept its doors open towards us. We are thankful to Cuba, but we wouldn't get involved in military actions; there would be a protest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Valencia and other regional analysts increasingly believe change in Cuba may be inevitable. Enrique Serrano, a Colombian political analyst specializing in Latin American authoritarianism, sees the current crisis as potentially terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's very unlikely that the government in Cuba might survive this year,&quot; Serrano tells &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;. &quot;I think finally we can change, and especially because Venezuela failed too, and even I think Nicaragua will fail to. Those authoritarian governments like Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba, what they try to do in real life is to gain time. They will disappear earlier or later.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Washington's Dilemma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expansion of Chinese and Russian intelligence capabilities in Cuba presents Washington with a challenge that defies easy solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Pfeiffer, &quot;continued U.S. pressure will make it difficult for China or Russia to assist the Cuban regime in getting out of this crisis of their own making.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure crisis complicates any potential diplomatic opening. A government desperate to keep the lights on may prove more willing to accommodate Chinese and Russian intelligence requirements than it would under less dire circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intelligence collection capabilities that Beijing and Moscow are establishing in Cuba will persist long after the current blackouts end. Once installed, telecommunications infrastructure operates for years or decades. Every blackout pushes Havana closer to Beijing, every grid failure necessitates Moscow's help; each represents an incremental expansion of foreign intelligence capabilities on American soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The opportunities stemming from Cuba's military and political alignment with the PRC, longstanding working relationship with its military and other personnel, geographical proximity, and other benefits, both before and during war, are hard to overstate,&quot; Ellis adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals. Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While US Vice President JD Vance used his remarks to the Munich Security Conference last year to hector and insult European leaders, Secretary of State Marco Rubio seemed more eager to flatter. And yet, America’s top diplomat merely confirmed that the transatlantic divide has become massive –&amp;nbsp;and is still widening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the post-Cold War era recedes, a more regional and competitive order is reasserting itself. Under these conditions, it is not surprising that larger powers would seek to shape their immediate surroundings – not only out of ambition, but also because they face constraints farther afield.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Media Literacy Isn’t Enough Anymore</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-literacy-isnt-enough-anymore</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;For years, media literacy has been treated as the solution to misinformation. I've advocated that position as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teach people to question headlines. Encourage them to check sources. Help them recognize bias and emotional manipulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that still matters. In fact, it matters more than ever. I often encourage people to think like intelligence analysts when they encounter information online. Pause. Ask who benefits. Look for what is missing. Compare across sources. Pay attention to emotion. Those skills are essential. They are part of being an informed citizen in a digital world. And yet, they are no longer sufficient on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The information environment has changed in ways that place unprecedented strain on individual judgment. AI-generated content now moves at a scale and speed no human can comfortably keep up with. Synthetic images, audio, and video are increasingly realistic. Recommendation engines quietly shape what we see first, what we see repeatedly, and what we never see at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even people who are informed and motivated can feel overwhelmed. Not because they lack critical thinking, but because the environment itself is engineered for constant engagement and reaction. Volume replaces deliberation. Speed crowds out reflection. This creates a subtle but important shift in responsibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When every individual is expected to function as a full-time analyst, constantly verifying and filtering, fatigue sets in. Naturally, people disengage. Or they rely on shortcuts. Familiar narratives feel safer. Emotion becomes a guide. Over time, trust erodes, not only in information, but in the idea that careful judgment is even possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where the conversation needs to broaden. Individual literacy and critical thinking remain necessary. We should continue to teach people how to evaluate information and resist online manipulation. At the same time, we have to recognize that resilience cannot rest entirely on individual effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthy societies depend on environments that support human cognition. Spaces that allow for pause. Systems that introduce friction in high-risk moments instead of eliminating it. Norms and designs that make room for judgment rather than constantly competing for attention. Freedom has always depended on those moments when humans decide what matters, rather than being swept along by momentum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world optimized for speed and engagement, protecting those moments may be one of the most important things we can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next phase of the clean-energy revolution will be led not by those who build more solar panels, but by those who modernize their grids, markets, and institutions accordingly. In fact, AI-ready grids will be as crucial to the Global South’s development as traditional infrastructure like roads and ports.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The future that the US Secretary of State touted at this year’s Munich Security Conference is not a vision of something to be built.

      <title>From the Monroe Doctrine to Maduro: The Precedent Problem in U.S.</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/monroe-doctrine-the-precedent-problem</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;More than a century ago, Elihu Root warned that American power was outrunning the institutions meant to govern it. Root held unique authority on this question. As both Secretary of War and Secretary of State under Theodore Roosevelt, he helped design the institutions and doctrines that carried the United States from a continental republic into the role of a global actor. He professionalized the Army after the Spanish-American War, imposed civilian and legal structure on an expanding military, and spent much of his career attempting to bind America’s power to durable norms before habit hardened into entitlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That project matters again. In January, the Trump administration carried out an operation that resulted in Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro being taken into U.S. custody and transferred to Florida to face federal narcoterrorism charges. The action was legally defensible under existing statutes and drew intense attention at home, dividing domestic opinion. It was also the kind of operation Root would have recognized as dangerous—not because it violated the law, but because it normalized the use of military force as an instrument of policy once legal justification could be established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Root confronted this problem directly in 1906, when he offered a sentence that has since been quoted far more often than it has been examined: “The United States is practically sovereign on this continent, and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition.” Read in isolation, the line can sound jingoistic, a blunt declaration of national entitlement. Root intended something narrower and more cautionary. He was describing a condition of power, not endorsing it. The sentence reflected his concern that American dominance exercised without discipline would weaken its own legitimacy. For Root, it always mattered that America acted within the law—but legality could not substitute for judgment. Once law became a post-hoc justification rather than a governing constraint, it would serve power instead of limiting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Root understood this danger because he had helped build the system he was warning against. The Monroe Doctrine, as originally conceived in 1823, was framed as a barrier against European intervention in the Western Hemisphere. It was defensive in character. The Roosevelt Corollary, which Root helped construct in 1904, transformed that posture into an assertion of U.S. authority to intervene when Washington judged instability intolerable. The logic was that disciplined American supervision was preferable to either European intervention or regional chaos. In practice, this produced a system of ongoing intervention that stopped short of formal empire while exercising many of its functions—military occupations in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, repeated interventions in Nicaragua and Cuba, and coercive diplomacy justified in the language of order and stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequences of that arrangement soon became visible. Root spent the latter part of his career arguing for international arbitration, multilateral institutions, and legal frameworks that would constrain American power even as the country grew stronger. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1912 for that work. But his warning proved easier to admire than to heed. Over time, his diagnosis of American dominance flattened into justification and extended well beyond its original hemispheric frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recognize the appeal of that logic because I once believed in it. In my twenties, working in Washington on national security issues at the end of the Cold War and into the early 2000s, I believed that the freedoms we enjoyed in the United States were a privilege that should not be exclusive, and that American power could and should be used to defend and extend the political conditions that made those freedoms possible. I sometimes imagined an America less burdened by the expectation that every use of power required a moral narrative alongside it—more openly transactional, less apologetic. I was a neocon before it mattered, and perhaps even MAGA before it was born. Iraq forced a reckoning, in part because it revealed how easily power justified by necessity could outrun foresight, legitimacy, and responsibility for what followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Maduro case, the debate in Washington quickly narrowed to whether the seizure could be defended legally. That question is necessary, but incomplete. The rule of law is the foundation of democratic authority, yet legality alone cannot carry the weight of wise judgment. A government can act within the law and still act unwisely, weakening the norms it depends on once power alone is no longer sufficient. American power should be used to confront injustice, and non-military tools are often preferable to force. The question is not whether to act, but how routinely power is applied once legality becomes its own justification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maduro episode is unlikely to be the last application of this logic. Attention inside the administration has already shifted toward Cuba, where Washington is applying pressure through fuel interdiction, secondary sanctions, and emergency authorities framed as enforcement rather than intervention. These measures are calibrated, legally grounded, and short of war. They represent controlled intervention rather than unconstrained power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That distinction matters—but it does not resolve the underlying risk. The Caracas operation involved the direct use of military force against a sitting head of state. Cuba involves economic pressure and interdiction. Root would have recognized the difference. He also would have understood how the former creates permission structures that make escalation from the latter more likely. The logic that validates measured coercion in Cuba is the same logic that justified seizing Maduro. Each action establishes precedent for the next. The question is not whether any single measure crosses a line, but whether the accumulation of incremental steps creates a system in which restraint becomes optional rather than structural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a deeper tension at work. If the United States treats spheres of influence as an acceptable norm in its own hemisphere, it becomes harder to reject similar claims elsewhere. Vladimir Putin’s arguments about near-abroad authority rest on a logic the United States weakens when it asserts special prerogatives rooted in power rather than principle. The cases are not morally equivalent. Putin’s interventions in Ukraine and Georgia involve territorial conquest and the erasure of sovereignty in ways American actions in the hemisphere do not. But the structure of the argument is similar enough that adversaries will exploit the parallel and allies will notice the inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Root understood that sovereignty without discipline invites decay. The question before us is not whether America can act this way. Clearly, it can. The question is whether doing so strengthens the order it claims to lead or erodes it through accumulated precedent. Power exercised without restraint rarely remains exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Root’s warning was never about weakness. It was about the difference between authority and dominance, between leadership that endures and power that exhausts itself. A century later, we are testing that distinction again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; The Cipher Brief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; because national security is everyone’s business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that geopolitical wrangling increasingly shapes international trade dynamics, India must reduce its dependence on imported energy to maximize its strategic autonomy. While it could invest more in hydrocarbons, the far better option is to become a renewables-powered electro-state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The USS &lt;em&gt;Gerald R. Ford&lt;/em&gt; is expected to join the USS &lt;em&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;/em&gt; in a significant build-up of U.S. military force in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump said this week that he does believe the U.S. will be able to reach a deal with Tehran but warns that if talks fail, the outcome could turn far more severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After meeting with the president in Washington this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is less optimistic about a deal, telling reporters on Thursday that “...I expressed general skepticism about any agreement with Iran, but I said that if an agreement is reached, it must include the elements that are important to Israel: not only the nuclear program, but also the ballistic missiles, and also the Iranian proxies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Iran’s national security chief Ali Larijani is warning that Tehran would strike U.S. bases in the region if it is attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt; spoke with former National Intelligence Manager for Iran at ODNI Norm Roule about what is likely to come next. Roule, who is also a Cipher Brief Expert, travels regularly to the region for meetings with senior leaders.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE INTERVIEW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: The U.S. is continuing to deploy military assets to the Middle East. How are you assessing the opportunities given where talks with Tehran are at the moment? What do you see as realistic U.S. objectives? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You’re correct to start with a focus on objectives. This will give us targets to assess risks and opportunities, as well as the report card against which the success of any strategy must be judged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of these are included in the Trump Administration’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf&quot;&gt;December 2025 National Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt;: avoid involvement in a costly regional war or nation-building, ensure that regional sea lanes and choke points remain open, and maintain stable energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Islamic Republic, every Administration – indeed the entire international community – has agreed that Tehran must cease the oppression of its people, must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon, its missile programs must be constrained, and its malign regional adventurism and support for terrorism must end. This latter set of ambitions has been part of not only this administration’s Iran strategy but also of the first Trump administration's strategy. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s May 2018 Twelve-Point &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/clip/public-affairs-event/secretary-pompeo-lays-out-strategy-against-iran/4730391&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; on Iran highlighted each of these goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the current approach addresses areas where there are different views on the balance between nonproliferation and broader regional issues, and on whether to resolve the nuclear issue first and address other issues later, or to handle them together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice once famously reminded a group that policymaking is done in a reality where we must remember that we are a country and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stanforddaily.com/2019/03/27/condoleezza-rice-discusses-biggest-threats-to-democracy-with-other-hoover-fellows/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://stanforddaily.com/2019/03/27/condoleezza-rice-discusses-biggest-threats-to-democracy-with-other-hoover-fellows/&quot;&gt;not an NGO&lt;/a&gt;. National interests, security, and power drive foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humanitarian goals will be important in our policies, but they won’t be the primary driver. Ours is not the first generation to face the challenge of how far we should go to encourage and militarily support those who courageously stand against tyrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodrow Wilson faced this dilemma as White Russian armies fought the Bolsheviks in 1918-1920. Several presidents were pressed to respond as Germans, Czechs, Hungarians, and other protestors valiantly stood up against heavily armed Soviet occupiers in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s. It’s easy to say we should do more, but these decisions are never clear. In this case, there have been many calls for military action, and it is easy to understand the rationale, watching the regime’s cruelty against the courage of Iranian protestors. But it is also unclear exactly what we are to attack, for how long, how we would measure success, whether the results would justify the ramifications of dealing with Iran’s military retaliation and lastly, whether the moment for such action has passed. Every presidential advisor would try to address these questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if policy choices regarding Iran involve profound risks, the events of this month show that kicking the can down the road is no less dangerous. Inevitably, the can gets heavier with every kick and the road gets shorter. There is absolutely nothing regarding the Iran threat today that hasn’t been predicted for years. The international community refused to risk the price of hard actions against Iran, and elected to use repeated attempts at diplomacy, corrosive sanctions (which were effective in limiting Iranian capabilities) and until June 2025, increasingly empty threats of military action to constrain Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of opportunities, the Administration has been consistent in its focus on four priorities with regard to Iran. The most recent has been humanitarian and involves the U.S. threat of military action against the regime if it continues using widespread murderous force against Iranian protestors. No one can deny the horrific and bloody crimes committed by this regime during the recent unrest. The violence has subsided along with the protests, albeit widespread arrests and detentions continue. The President has claimed that his threats of military action limited Iran’s use of violence and stopped Iran from hanging large numbers of protestors. Some certainly argue that we should have used military action to aid the protesters, but this raises the question I mentioned earlier and related issues about whether we had sufficient assets in the area to address potential “Day After” consequences. This is a question with no single clear answer. However, our use of diplomatic, economic, and military pressure to prevent regime violence against protesters is appropriate and consistent with our national values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: The White House is now focused on Iran’s nuclear, missile, and regional threats. Talk to us about why this is a priority and whether the current moment is an opportunity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s start with Iran’s nuclear program. The June 2025 Twelve-Day War severely degraded – at least for now – Iran’s nuclear weapons capability. But that capability can be rebuilt, and if Iran has any enrichment capacity, especially one not under international supervision, they can try to produce weapons-grade enriched uranium. But if Iran doesn’t agree diplomatically not to rebuild these capabilities and to provide the International Atomic Energy Agency with the access it requires, we should steel ourselves to the requirement that the Israelis or we will need to repeat the June 2025 military strikes when Iran chooses to rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we have the Iranian ballistic missile threat. The unclassified &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dia.mil/Portals/110/Documents/News/golden_dome.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.dia.mil/Portals/110/Documents/News/golden_dome.pdf&quot;&gt;May 2025 Defense Intelligence Assessment&lt;/a&gt; stated that Iran’s space-launch vehicle program could give it the capability to build as many as sixty intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran’s repeated use of ballistic missiles against multiple countries makes it reasonable for Israel to be concerned about the long-term size and direction of this program as well. Iran’s missile program is not currently a threat to Western Europe. If Iran builds ICBMs, this, of course, changes. The idea that anyone would allow a country with Iran’s political, military, and nuclear history to build dozens of potentially nuclear-tipped ICBMs within nine years should not be acceptable. It would also be too easy to imagine a scenario in which Iran and North Korea joined forces to threaten the U.S. Homeland. So, we either compel Iran to change the course of its ballistic missile program, work with Europe to build a costly missile shield, or destroy that program militarily now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, Iran’s Quds Force remains operational and has begun to repeat what will be a several-year campaign to reconstitute its regional proxy program. This is not the first time the Quds Force has been required to rebuild a regional program amid great risk to the regime. In fact, it’s the third time since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By any traditional measure, the Islamic Republic represents a failed revolutionary state ruling a disillusioned and angry population. In many ways, it resembles the final years of the Soviet Union: an ossified regime whose ideology is dismissed even by its most ardent supporters. The regime retains power through repression, coercion, corruption, and a multi-layered system of lucrative patronage that its most potent supporters would lose in any reformed government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration’s rhetoric and actions make a reasonable case that the current moment should be tested to see whether, with further pressure – which could include military action – the regime would sacrifice these malign activities in exchange for sanctions relief that would allow the Islamic Republic to survive. This won’t satisfy those who seek regime change, but it does parallel Washington’s approach to Venezuela. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: How would you assess Iran’s losses to date?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; By any measure, Iran’s losses have been extraordinary, consequential, and unprecedented in modern history for a country of its size, regional influence, and global economic impact in the energy market. The last two years have been crowded with examples of the collapse of its political, economic, and national security architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of leadership, the regime has endured the death of President Ebrahim Raisi, who was highly likely to be Supreme Leader Khamenei’s choice. His passing was followed by a historic low turnout in elections that led to the Pezeshkian presidency. Pezeshkian failed to deliver on his economic promises. His tenure has included the dismissal or resignation of two vice presidents, two cabinet officials, and other senior officials. He spends much of his time apologizing to the Iranian people for the government's failures, hoping this tactic will win him popular support. It’s somewhat understandable in that the economic complaints that ignited Iran’s recent nationwide unrest occurred in a country that has endured months of shortages of water, electricity, natural gas, and refined products, which forces the repeated closure of schools, government offices, and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Bank estimates that one-third of Iranians (25-26 million) are below the poverty line. Annual inflation reached 43 percent in December 2025. The rial, which fell to 1.43 million to the dollar before the unrest, just reached 1.63 million to the dollar and appears to have no bottom. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent’s comments on recent U.S. expanded sanctions in response to Iran’s handling of protests underscores Washington’s intent to use whatever economic tools it can to pressure Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: If you’re looking at this in terms of Iran’s own national security, how does it look?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of national security, the picture is bleak. Over the past two years, Israel killed the commanders of Iran’s primary proxy partners and destroyed the group's strategic capacity. Russia and China proved to be of no help in the June War, nor could they stop the reimposition of United Nations Security Council Sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of Syria and Venezuela cost Iran its closest external allies, reducing its regional and global political reach. The June War was a profound defeat for Iran’s air defenses and intelligence services. Israel and the U.S. easily destroyed key elements of Iran’s hugely expensive nuclear program, an effort that has cost billions of dollars and for which Iran has endured decades of political and economic isolation. The conflict cost Tehran many of its most experienced military and nuclear personnel, and left Iran with billions of dollars in damage to its nuclear and missile infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Iran’s murderous killing of protestors and internet shutdown starkly illustrated that the most successful aspect of the regime’s national security investments remains its tools of oppression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: Many have described Tehran today as weak. Yet the regime keeps surviving protests. Its missile programs are considered a potential threat, and policymakers are worried about its capacity to threaten the Strait of Hormuz, impacting energy markets. What’s your take on this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The regime is weaker in many areas, but it is more accurate to say that the regime has never been more fragile and is strategically weaker than it has been in decades. All of this is known to Iran’s Supreme National Security Council. But they can also list strengths they believe will help them survive. I would rather not list these publicly but suffice it to say that key elites and security elements remain unified, disciplined, and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the government’s deep national unpopularity is a fact, it can’t be ignored, as a substantial portion of the population remains uncommitted to its overthrow, and some are committed to its survival rather than supporting the opposition. Externally, it may have no reliable state allies, but nor does it face an international coalition. The U.S. is its primary adversary. What it achieves against Washington will shape its relations with the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran may not be able to compete with the U.S. militarily, but that has always been the case. Its leaders know that they must be able to threaten an asymmetric response: regional and global economic destruction by missile, drones, and cyber-attacks will immediately begin should the U.S. attack Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This list should leave your readers with the sense that these men believe the best days of the regime are ahead. That would imply stupidity, which is not a characteristic that gets one through Iran’s national security shark pool of political and policy challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wake every morning, knowing that their domestic political and economic realities make another cycle of nationwide anti-regime unrest inevitable. The Supreme Leader will be 87-years old on April 19. His eventual passing will trigger the final transition to the regime’s post-revolutionary generation and they have had years to prepare for this moment. But his passing, which could occur at any time, could create a new crisis. And of course, if an actual military conflict with the U.S. takes place, the survival of the regime, and the personal survival of those in Iran’s leadership could be in question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: How are you assessing the impact of the Trump administration’s approach right now?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The structure of the Trump administration’s strategy remains strategically conventional. The administration’s primary goal is a diplomatic outcome that avoids a conventional war or an episode that leaves Iran empowered and U.S. credibility damaged. Hence, the likelihood of a dramatically powerful military attack on Iran remains high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration has made no secret of its buildup of one of the most powerful offensive air, missile, and air defense capabilities in history. Israel has also threatened military action. The President is also reportedly considering dispatching another aircraft carrier task force to augment his offensive capabilities further. The way this force has been deployed thus far shows that it is part of the pressure campaign and that the President has not yet authorized military operations. Of course, this last point could change at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration has deployed a senior diplomatic team and urged regional partners to press Iran to engage with the U.S. to reach a deal. The administration has loudly announced new economic pressure on Iran and of course, deployed a massive military force. All of this is meant to pressure Iran’s leaders into making concessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the subject of timelines. This current process is likely to last until the president and his advisors believe they have exhausted diplomacy. If the administration continues to believe it must strategically change Iran’s nuclear, missile, and Qods Force, then military action becomes a very high probability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predicting this timeline is impossible as it is shaped by Iran’s decisions, partner input, U.S. political conditions, and even unexpected events, such as a sudden spike in unrest within Iran, the sudden death of the Supreme Leader, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: What about Iran’s response?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Iran needs to conduct multiple actions simultaneously to reduce the pressure on the regime and improve its chance of long-term survival. These steps include ending the protests, improving its military capabilities, and developing a diplomatic strategy to delay a U.S. military strike. But in the near term, Tehran remains unlikely to give Washington what it wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domestically, Tehran must ensure and demonstrate leadership and unity among security forces. The country’s leadership will continue to comprise a spectrum of trusted actors. Security forces will aggressively seek to locate and detain anyone believed to have been part of the recent unrest and anyone who they believe has engaged in unauthorized contact with Western opposition or media, and expedite trials to show that the regime’s control remains strong. The regime will seek opportunities to project an atmosphere of normalcy and, as we have already seen, organize pro-regime rallies and events to show that it has its own base of support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Externally, the regime will seek to project defiance and confidence. Its primary diplomatic goal will be to buy time and prevent coalitions from forming, so it will seek negotiations, indirectly whenever possible, and will always focus on the most complicated issue: the nuclear program. Its public comments on the talks will be positive and vague. This has been its usual practice because doing so has a positive impact on the value of the rial to the dollar and supports the regime’s propaganda on diplomacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should expect Tehran to maintain oil production and maybe even try to increase floating storage on shadow-fleet assets in Asia to allow it to meet contracts during any short-term conflict with the U.S. If it feels it needs to close the Strait of Hormuz, it has multiple ways of doing so, but we shouldn’t be surprised if the U.S. military has multiple options for dealing with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it will prepare missile and cyber operations both to signal deterrence and to survive any U.S. and possibly combined U.S.-Israel attack. In the absence of a credible air defense, its deterrence rests on a public diplomacy narrative that it stands ready to launch broad attacks against every U.S. base in the region, Israel, and to close the Strait of Hormuz and perhaps attack oil export facilities, damaging the international oil market, if the U.S. attacks. Iran hopes these statements will spark debate in the U.S. and diplomatic pressure from the international community against Washington over an attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

      <title>Confidence, Interoperability, and the Limits of U.S. Decision Systems</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/confidence-interoperability-and-the-limits-of-u-s-decision-systems</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;In recent months, U.S. policy debates have increasingly acknowledged that the decisive contests of the 21st century will not be fought primarily on conventional battlefields. They will be fought in the cognitive domain, through influence, perception, legitimacy, and decision velocity. This recognition is important and depends on an adequate technical and institutional layer to deliver durable strategic advantage. Cognitive advantage cannot be declared. It must be engineered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States does not lack data, expertise, or analytic talent. What it lacks is decision-shaping architecture capable of producing consistently high-confidence strategic judgment in complex, adaptive environments. The result is a persistent gap between how confident U.S. decisions appear and how reliable they are - especially in Gray Zone conflicts where informal networks, narrative control, and societal resilience determine outcomes long before failure becomes visible. Afghanistan was not an anomaly. Nor will it be the last warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Confidence Illusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In U.S. national security discourse, the phrase “high confidence” carries enormous weight. It signals authority, rigor, and analytical closure. Yet extensive research into expert judgment, including studies of national-security professionals themselves, shows that confidence is routinely mis-calibrated in complex political environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judgments expressed with 80–90 percent confidence often prove correct closer to 50–70 percent of the time in complex, real-world strategic settings. This is not a marginal error. It is a structural one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is not individual analysts. It is how institutions aggregate information, frame uncertainty, and present judgment to decision-makers. While pockets of analytic under confidence have existed historically, recent large-scale evidence shows overconfidence is now the dominant institutional risk at the decision level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent U.S. experience from Iraq to Afghanistan suggests that institutional confidence is often declared without calibration, while systems lack mechanisms to enforce learning when that confidence proves misplaced. In kinetic conflicts, this gap can be masked by overwhelming force. In Gray Zone contests, it is fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afghanistan: Studied Failure Without Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few conflicts in modern U.S. history have been studied as extensively as Afghanistan. Over two decades, the U.S. government produced hundreds of strategies, assessments, revisions, and after-action reviews. After the collapse of 2021, that effort intensified: inspector general reports, departmental after-action reviews, congressional investigations, and now a congressionally mandated Afghanistan War Commission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volume of analysis is not the problem. The problem is that these efforts never coalesced into a unified learning system. Across reports, the same lessons recur misjudged political legitimacy, overestimated partner capacity, underestimated informal power networks, ignored warning indicators, and persistent optimism unsupported by ground truth. Yet there is no evidence of a shared architecture that connected these findings across agencies, tracked which assumptions repeatedly failed, or recalibrated confidence over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lessons were documented, not operationalized. Knowledge was archived, not integrated. Each new plan began largely anew, informed by memory and narrative rather than by a living system of institutional learning. When failure came, it appeared suddenly. In reality, it had been structurally prepared for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories.

More detailed. More comprehensive. More authoritative. But reports - even excellent ones - do not learn. Learning systems require interoperability: shared data models, common assumptions, feedback loops, and mechanisms that measure accuracy over time. They require the ability to test judgments against outcomes, update beliefs, and carry lessons forward into new contexts. Absent this architecture, reports function as historical records rather than decision engines. They improve documentation, not confidence. This is why the United States can spend decades studying Afghanistan and still enter new Gray Zone engagements without demonstrably higher confidence than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asking the Wrong Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The confidence problem is compounded by a deeper analytic flaw: U.S. systems are often designed to answer the wrong questions. Many contemporary analytic and AI-enabled tools optimize for what is verifiable, auditable, or easily measured. In the information domain, they ask whether content is authentic or false. In compliance and due diligence, they ask whether an individual or entity appears in a registry or sanctions database. In governance reform, they ask whether a program is efficient or wasteful. These questions are not irrelevant, but they are rarely decisive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray Zone conflicts hinge on different variables: who influences whom, through which networks, toward what behavioral effect. They hinge on informal authority, narrative resonance, social trust, and the ability of adversaries to adapt faster than bureaucratic learning cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A video can be authentic and still strategically effective as disinformation. An individual can be absent from any database and still shape ideology, mobilization, or legitimacy within a community. A system can appear efficient while quietly eroding the functions that sustain resilience. When analytic systems are designed around shallow questions, they create an illusion of understanding precisely where understanding matters most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOGE and the Domestic Mirror&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This failure pattern is not confined to foreign policy. Recent government efficiency initiatives-often grouped under the banner of “Department of Government Efficiency” or DOGE - style reforms - illustrate the same analytic tendency in domestic governance. These efforts framed government primarily as a cost and efficiency problem. Success was measured in budget reductions, headcount cuts, and streamlined processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they largely did not assess were system functions, hidden dependencies, mission-critical resilience, or second-order effects. Independent reviews later showed that efficiency gains often disrupted oversight and weakened essential capabilities - not because reform was misguided, but because the wrong questions were prioritized. DOGE did not fail for lack of data or ambition. It failed because it optimized what was measurable while missing what was decisive. The parallel to national security strategy is direct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Gray Zone Conflicts Punish Miscalibration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray Zone conflicts are unforgiving environments for miscalibrated confidence. They unfold slowly, adaptively, and below the threshold of overt war. By the time failure becomes visible, the decisive contests - over legitimacy, elite alignment, and narrative control - have already been lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adversaries in these environments do not seek decisive battles. They seek to exploit institutional blind spots, fragmented learning, and overconfident decision cycles. They build networks that persist through shocks, cultivate influence that survives regime change, and weaponize uncertainty itself. When U.S. decision systems cannot reliably distinguish between what is known, what is assumed, and what is merely believed, they cede cognitive advantage by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What “90 Percent Confidence” Actually Means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This critique is often misunderstood as a call for predictive omniscience. It is not. According to existing standards, No system can achieve near-perfect confidence in open-ended geopolitical outcomes. But research from forecasting science, high-reliability organizations, and complex systems analysis shows that high confidence is achievable for bounded questions - if systems are designed correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narrowly scoped judgments, explicit assumptions, calibrated forecasting, continuous feedback, and accountability for accuracy can push reliability toward 90 percent in defined decision contexts. This is not theoretical. It has been demonstrated repeatedly in domains that take learning seriously. What the U.S. lacks is not the science or the technology. It is the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Advantage Requires Cognitive Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central lesson of Afghanistan, Gray Zone conflict, and even domestic governance reform is the same: data abundance without learning architecture produces confidence illusions, not advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive advantage is not about thinking harder or collecting more information. It is about building systems that can integrate knowledge, test assumptions, recalibrate confidence, and adapt before failure becomes visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until U.S. decision-shaping systems are redesigned around these principles, the United States will continue to repeat familiar patterns - confident, well-intentioned, and structurally unprepared for the conflicts that matter most. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning is clear. The opportunity remains with Yaqin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; The Cipher Brief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; because national security is everyone’s business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mexico's low and falling growth is not the result of macroeconomic instability, a lack of investment, insufficient labor, or poor export performance. Rather, it stems from low productivity, an unnecessarily large informal sector, and the ruling party's persistent failure to address the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Autonomy on the Battlefield</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/autonomy-on-the-battlefield</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE IRON TRIANGLE — &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue XX: The Buzz Around Autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to The Iron Triangle, the column serving Procurement Officers tasked with buying the future, the Investors funding the next generation of defense technology, and the Policy Wonks analyzing its impact on the global order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This issue explores the monumental push toward autonomy in defense technology and the fundamental shift required in our understanding of command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Backdrop: Redefining Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its purest sense, autonomy is the condition of self-government. When we overlay that concept onto military machines and armed drones, the immediate fear is that we are outsourcing the moral weight of life and death to an algorithm. I’ve seen the Terminator series, so I know what you’re thinking. No, you don’t need to learn how to make a pipe bomb. It’s not as bad as you think… maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the reality of military command is more nuanced. To understand autonomy in defense technology, I want to first be clear about how the military defines command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Command is composed of three elements: authority, responsibility, and decision-making. Authority is the delegated power to make decisions and use resources. Responsibility is the legal and ethical obligation for everything a unit does or fails to do. And decision-making is the process of translating high-level intent into actionable orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autonomy does not replace the commander; it enables the commander to aggregate and disaggregate aspects of Command and Control (C2)&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Specifically, autonomy allows a commander to delegate control to a machine while maintaining command. However simple this sounds, it is a monumental mindset shift for many commanders. To be successful, this will require reshaping some commanders’ understanding of technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use autonomous systems appropriately, the commander assigns a framework of authority. This authority might be a benign task, such as &quot;Conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance in order to identify the enemy within [defined area].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the opposite end of the spectrum, such as in high-intensity, peer-conflict scenarios where there is no civilian presence, &quot;Identify and destroy targets in [defined area].&quot; The authorities a commander assigns to autonomous systems will depend heavily on their risk calculations and dozens of other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rewards: Why Accept the Risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that all responsibility for the mission remains with the commander. Given the potential risks outlined above, why would a commander accept responsibility for an autonomous system’s performance? Because autonomous systems will be required not only for survival, but to fight and win on a modern, transparent battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operational Tempo (OPTEMPO). Autonomy denies the adversary the ability to reset during what would otherwise be natural lulls in combat operations. It enables a constant and consistent pressure campaign that human operators, limited by fatigue, cognitive bandwidth, and resources, cannot sustain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Force Protection and Attrition. We must shift our thinking toward lifecycle protection. Autonomy allows us to project power and achieve effects without putting a human in the loop–where they are most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive Decoupling. By reducing the pilot-to-platform ratio from 1:1 to 1:Many, autonomy frees the commander’s mind to focus on the strategic rather than the tactical, effectively reducing cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Implications: The Path Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move autonomy to battlefield reality, we must address three critical pillars:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-Cost Near-Exquisite Systems. Commanders cannot get comfortable with autonomy if they are afraid to lose their assets. We must continue to move away from high-cost platforms toward mass-producible, near-exquisite systems that allow for the thousands of training iterations required to build trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interoperability. A quadcopter built in a Florida garage must immediately work cohesively with a bespoke system from a big defense prime. If autonomous systems cannot operate across-domains, if they aren’t vendor-agnostic, and if they can’t operate as one element of a swarm ecosystem, they aren’t force multipliers; they are a logistics burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief applies expert-level context to national and global security stories. Grant yourself full-access to Cipher Brief expert insights, analysis and private briefings in the new year by &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;becoming a Subscriber+Member&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;End Vendor Lock-In. Continuous innovation is the only defense against adversarial countermeasures, and rigid multi-year contracts stifle technology iteration. We need a development operations model for hardware, where field feedback is transferred directly to engineers, rapid improvements are made, and systems are re-fielded. Vendors need to be held accountable–by losing profitable contracts–when they fail against this standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary for the Triangle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Procurement Officer. Stop buying platforms and start buying ecosystems that support delegated authority, scalability, and innovation. Establish criteria for continuously evaluating technology and hold companies accountable. I commend the Department of Defense for acknowledging this need with more flexible contract mechanisms, but more can be done. There are many small, innovative technologies that might make a substantive difference if they are given an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Investor. Look for companies whose technology is not dependent on specific hardware, and for those who are open to rapidly partnering with other OEMs to overcome technical limitations. There are an unprecedented number of small defense technology firms in today’s ecosystem and there will be a consolidation within two-to-five years. If a company insists that every capability is vertically integrated, there is a strong likelihood that they will be outpaced by an up-and-comer or a conglomeration who is more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Policy Wonk. The debate isn't about whether machines will make decisions, but how we legally and ethically define the authority we give them. Setting conditions that promote and reward innovation will de-risk this transition now. We also need to think about the resources we provide the services for training, and how rules of engagement stack against those of our adversaries. This will all lead to better outcomes when it counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coming years will be a period of creative destruction for the defense industry. The era of proprietary technology is ending, replaced by an ecosystem where the only constant is change. We must reward the agile and hold the stagnant accountable. Whether it’s a garage-born startup or a legacy prime, the winners will be those who embrace the DevOps of hardware and the radical transparency of interoperable swarms. Autonomy is the catalyst; how we choose to fund, buy, and govern it will determine who leads the global order for the next century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joey Gagnard is a Cipher Brief columnist who regularly shares his perspective on national security and technology via his Iron Triangle column.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <title>Standing Up to a Spy: My Run-In with Aldrich Ames</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/standing-up-to-a-spy-my-run-in-with-aldrich-ames</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;I had an unpleasant episode with Aldrich Ames which taught me some life lessons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a mid-level CIA analyst working Caucasus and Central Asian issues in the 1990s. My job responsibilities then included reviewing agency participation in conferences located in that part of the world, helping assure the environment was conducive to the type of gathering being proposed and identifying any threats there might be. The reviews were usually noncontroversial and proforma, perfectly suited for a mid-level analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometime, though, in mid 1993, a memo came across my desk from a desk officer in the CIA’s Counter Narcotics Center (CNC) proposing a senior level CNC conference in that part of the world that I worked. I felt strongly there were security risks associated with the gathering that did not justify agency participation. I was also concerned that the host country could not adequately address the conference logistics. I documented my concerns, did not sign off, and moved on, without giving the subject any additional thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following day, as I was reading through my cables, I looked up from my computer to find a very unkempt individual, about 20 years my senior with bushy eyebrows and a dirty, wispy looking mustache hovering over me, in essence, violating my personal space. He introduced himself as Aldrich Ames, the individual planning the conference which I had refused to sign off on the day before. He demanded to know how I had the gall to stand in the way of this important conference. I explained to this aggressive individual that I saw no upside to holding such a conference where he had proposed and explained to him my security and logistics concerns. He continued by berating me for not understanding the former Soviet Union. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, I was in the earlier stages of my career but by then I had an undergraduate and graduate degree in Soviet Studies. I studied in Moscow and St. Petersburg. I wrote my master’s thesis on the role of women in Uzbek politics, participated in several summer workshops at Harvard University and other universities focused on Ukraine and Central Asia, had published articles in academic journals on Central Asia, had spoken on many conference panels regarding Soviet and Former Soviet Union politics, and had just completed a year as part of the CIA Director’s Exceptional Analyst Program studying the history and culture of Azerbaijan and Azeri language. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stood my ground with Aldrich Ames and politely invited him to leave. Not to be deterred, Ames came back to my desk a few times. I was not there and my cubicle-mates alerted me to the fact that the unkempt man from the CNC was looking for me. He found me at my desk a few weeks later. By then, he was even more surly and patronizing. He told me that he was a senior operations officer and that I was thwarting important operations. I told him to get the Department of Operations to sign off and then come back to me. He then complained to my boss about the stupid analyst. She had my back but as a fairly young analyst, I was shaken by his demeanor and his threats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months later I heard that the CNC Conference was happening but maybe somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Ames was arrested for espionage on his way to this relocated conference shortly thereafter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I later came to know that Mr. Ames may have shared my analysis with the Russians. But, I was not in harm's way. More importantly, I remember the families and loved ones of those executed due to Ames’ betrayals and pay tribute to them and the colleagues whose careers he sidetracked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just another ugly, though inconsequential story in the Aldrich Ames saga. What I learned as an analyst who unwittingly stood up to a spy is to trust your instincts, stand your ground, expertise matters, and that ultimately bad people cannot disguise that they are bad people. And Mr. Ames should have taken my advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; The Cipher Brief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; because national security is everyone’s business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If NATO is serious about managing the Russian threat identified in its own strategy documents, it must focus its efforts where deterrence is most fragile. Lithuania's plans for a new training ground near the Suwałki corridor are thus a test case for assessing US and European resolve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US voters may well embrace the Democratic Party in this year’s midterm elections. But neither that outcome nor the 2028 election is likely to lead to a realignment of US politics that delivers a government capable of sustaining policies long enough to address the problems the country faces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Russia’s Foreign Fighter Pipeline: How Moscow Exploits Global Poverty to Feed Ukraine’s Frontlines</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russias-foreign-fighter-pipeline</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/pokrovske-ukraine-september-6-ukrainian-servicemen-aim-a-mortar-at-a-training-range-on-september-6-2025-in-pokrovske-dnipr.jpg?id=63926788&amp;amp;width=1245&amp;amp;height=700&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C53%2C0%2C54&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP DIVE —&lt;/strong&gt; Moscow has spent nearly four years burning through human resources in Ukraine, and now they’ve found a new way to fill the gaps of loss: exploiting the Global South. Russia is luring in thousands of men with promises of ‘work’ or ‘security,’ only to hand them a rifle. When these guys eventually head home, their own governments are going to be left dealing with the fallout of having thousands of war-hardened veterans they never asked for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s military intelligence has&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/europe/russia-recruits-foreign-fighters-ukraine-intl-cmd&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;identified&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; more than 18,000 foreigners from 128 countries who have fought or are currently fighting for Russian forces. At least 3,388 of these fighters have been&lt;a href=&quot;https://odessa-journal.com/more-than-18000-foreigners-are-fighting-on-russias-side-against-ukraine&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;killed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, according to Ukrainian officials. The death toll includes citizens from Cuba, Nepal, India, Kenya, and across Central Asia — men who often arrived in Russia seeking construction jobs or warehouse work, only to find themselves thrust into Ukraine’s grinding war of attrition with minimal training and false promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Russia has no choice but to attempt to continue its foreign recruitment model given Russian military casualties and political realities of a significant mobilization in President Putin’s political bases in Moscow and Saint Petersburg,” Alex Plitsas, nonresident senior fellow with the Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council, tells The Cipher Brief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Washington, the pipeline carries implications beyond the immediate battlefield. Combat-hardened fighters from regions where the United States competes with Russia for&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foreignaffairs.com/africa/right-way-america-counter-russia-africa&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;influence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, particularly across Africa and Latin America, will eventually return home potentially equipped with drone warfare expertise, small arms proficiency, and tactical knowledge gained in Europe’s most technologically advanced land war since 1945.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former AFRICOM commander General Stephen Townsend&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10220461.2022.2136236&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;warned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that Russia’s meddling in Africa comprises the “second biggest threat to US security interests” after terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Architecture of Exploitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow has effectively turned its migration system into a trap, routinely building military recruitment offices right beside immigration facilities where beatings and freezing cells are used to coerce signatures. Detention or military service are often the only options for migrants in legal limbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incentives are also used to exploit poverty. Nepali recruits&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/10/asia/nepal-fighters-russia-ukraine-families-intl-cmd&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;receive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 75,000 to 200,000 rubles monthly, or $750 to $2,000, dwarfing local earnings but representing only a fraction of Russian compensation. Cuban networks promise&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/09/05/russian-recruiters-lure-cubans-to-fight-in-ukraine-with-promises-of-money-citizenship-a82360&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;citizenship&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and generous payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Human Trafficking Pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several governments now&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2024/10/10/russia-ukraine-war-drones-foreign-workers/8d97fc08-86bd-11ef-8274-e0558282750d_story.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;describe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; these recruitment tactics as outright human trafficking. In Kenya, an investigation&lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.africa/kenya/news/diaspora/diaspora-news/how-young-kenyan-women-are-exploited-in-russian-drone-factories-5045164&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;revealed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that citizens were promised stable jobs only to find themselves on drone assembly lines in active war zones. India has&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/03/08/india-raids-network-sending-citizens-to-fight-for-russia-a84383&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;documented&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a similar pattern, with at least 35 of its nationals sent to the front lines against their will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nepal perhaps serves as the most stark&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/01/05/nepal-suspends-work-permits-for-russia-and-ukraine-amid-soldiers-deaths-reuters-a83649&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; example&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of this human cost. Officially, 14 Nepalis are confirmed dead, but estimates suggest as many as 2,000 may have enlisted in Russian forces. The subsequent outrage in Kathmandu led to Russia and Ukraine’s work permits being denied in early 2024. This proved effective, at least temporarily, as only one known Nepali citizen had signed a contract in the first ten months of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation, however, is harrowing on the ground. Foreign recruits are deployed to frontline assaults after just a week of training, according to Ukrainian prisoners of war. Despite promises of non-combat roles, some of these men signed Russian-language contracts they couldn’t even read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The foreign recruits have proven to be less effective as a result of the minimal amount of training and poor equipment that they receive upon joining,” says Plitsas. “Russia is throwing bodies at the problem, so to speak, in terms of trying to fortify the front lines and replacing fallen Russian troops.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today. Gain access to save your virtual seat now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The political calculus is deliberate. Plitsas highlights that there are far fewer political ramifications for losing foreign fighters than for Russian citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many see these foreigners as having volunteered, so if they die in combat, it doesn’t have a significant reflection within Russian society,” he continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central Asian migrants face particular vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow has increasingly turned its attention to the four million Central Asian migrants living within its borders to solve its mounting personnel shortages. Since the legal shifts in September 2022, the Kremlin has effectively tied residency and citizenship to military service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uzbeks and Tajiks working in Russia face a forced choice: enlist or lose their legal status. It is common for new arrivals’ residency applications to be stalled unless they sign a military contract, making them a prime target for Russian recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Manpower Calculus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow’s reliance on foreign recruits reflects an acute strain on its ability to sustain combat operations. Western estimates suggest Russia has suffered approximately&lt;a href=&quot;https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/01/15/british-intelligence-russia-likely-lost-415000-soldiers-killed-and-injured-in-2025/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;1.2 million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; casualties — killed and wounded — since February 2022.

This pace requires exploiting every available demographic, with provincial governments&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-recruitment-soldiers-ukraine-war-personnel-bonuses/33572319.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;pressured&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to meet&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/10/16/regions-calling-governments-cut-back-on-once-lucrative-military-enlistment-payments-a90832&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;quotas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet debate exists over the scale’s significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Russian army does not depend critically on foreign mercenaries,” Oleg Ignatov, Senior Analyst for Russia at the Crisis Group, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “The exact number of foreign mercenaries in the Russian army is unknown, but it is small compared to the total number of troops.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent estimates hover around 1,500, while Russian officials claim 30,000 total — a fraction of Russia’s roughly&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67698774&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;700,000 troops&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, there is no evidence that foreign mercenaries stand out among Russian soldiers and suffer significant losses compared to other soldiers,” Ignatov insists, noting North Korean forces initially suffered heavy losses because “they were not adapted to the realities of war in Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All other foreigners serve in Russian units and suffer the same losses as all other servicemen in these units,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern reflects a broader strategic reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ignatov, “both Russia and Ukraine are experiencing a shortage of manpower for this type of war, which explains their efforts to recruit foreigners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition, Russia needs to maintain its manpower advantage on the front lines, which it gained by the end of 2023-early 2024,” he points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plitsas frames the imperative more starkly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Russia has no choice but to attempt to continue its foreign recruitment model given Russian military casualties and political realities of a significant mobilization in President Putin’s political bases in Moscow and Saint Petersburg,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That political risk became clear more than three years ago. Moscow remains wary of the domestic fallout that followed the September 2022 mobilization. The Kremlin thus relies on foreign recruitment to maintain frontline numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Security Aftermath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-term security implications of Russia’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/foreign-troops-help-putin-avoid-pitfalls-of-another-russian-mobilization/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;foreign&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recruitment extend far beyond the battlefield.

Veterans returning with hands-on experience could rapidly advance militant and criminal capabilities from Latin America to Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some nations are trying, or tried, to push back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan opened a record 709 criminal cases in 2025 against citizens who joined Russian formations, with sentences ranging from 4.5 to 5 years. Kyrgyzstan’s attempt to set a legal precedent, however, fell flat when the Kremlin stepped in with pressure to drop charges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of the death toll of more than 120 Uzbek, Tajik, and Kyrgyz fighters by late 2024, accountability remains nonexistent. It is common for recruits to hide behind new Russian passports, which legally place them beyond the reach of their home governments. The real worry now isn’t just the dead, but the survivors; men who stay in Russia with specialized combat training and no clear path except drifting into the criminal margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Cuba, which&lt;a href=&quot;https://infobrics.org/en/post/43585&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;joined&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the Russian-led BRICS bloc, estimates suggest up to&lt;a href=&quot;https://cubacenter.org/cuba-brief/2025/09/23/cubabrief-20000-cubans-recruited-to-fight-for-russia-against-ukraine-since-2022-the-european-union-remains-cubas-top-trading-partner/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;20,000&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Cubans recruited since 2022, with&lt;a href=&quot;https://smallwarsjournal.com/2025/08/30/russia-recruits-cubans-for-the-frontlines-in-ukraine-its-all-been-a-scam-el-pais/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;200 to 300&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; killed.

Due to the high percentage of active military personnel and ex-military personnel fighting under the Russian banner, Cuba’s government may be tacitly permitting the recruitment pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/6/nepal-detains-10-over-allegations-they-sent-citizens-to-russian-army&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Nepal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-india-migrant-workers-rcna148584&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;India’s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aggressive crackdowns, Havana’s muted response raises questions about quid pro quo arrangements with Moscow, particularly as Cuba faces a severe&lt;a href=&quot;https://tfiglobalnews.com/2025/07/26/cuba-officially-joins-the-brics-development-bank-challenges-60-years-of-u-s-blockade-and-isolation/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;economic crisis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and depends heavily on Russian support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Travel bans and efforts by governments to stop their citizens from volunteering will have some impact, though the overall numbers are still small in general terms,” Plitsas observes. “Augmenting Russian troops with foreign troops has also proven to be efficient, though poor training and equipment limit overall effectiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offensive exploits global inequality while exporting costs to nations with limited pushback capacity. While Moscow claims foreign recruits demonstrate international support for the war, the reality is much bleaker: it’s a trafficking operation that targets the poor and desperate. The same thing happened in Syria and Iraq, demonstrating to the international community that a handful of combat-hardened veterans can destabilize an entire country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these men return to Africa or South Asia with expertise in drone strikes and urban warfare, they often don’t just go back to civilian life; they become a ready-made kit for insurgencies or criminal groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Foreign governments have taken some steps to try to stem the flow of foreign fighters supporting Russia, but the populations involved have been relatively small, and it hasn’t been seen as a significant enough problem for home governments to take more significant action to date,” Plitsas explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He identifies structural challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many of the fighters come from countries that are friendly to Russia, and so banning travel, or things of that nature, becomes more difficult given the status of the relationship between the countries,” Plitsas continues. “Also, when you’re traveling abroad and need a visa, the country you are traveling to has to grant it to you. Russia is incentivized to allow the flow to continue, as the burden is on Russia to grant the visa, not the home country. It makes policing the effort very difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As battlefield casualties mount and domestic constraints prevent mobilization, foreign recruitment provides a crucial release valve for Moscow. As a result, thousands of people have been channeled into war under false pretenses, leaving survivors scarred and equipped with military skills posing long-term security risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Ignatov pushes back against the alarmist framing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“War is a serious trauma, and all soldiers need psychological help. But I don’t think there are any risks of radicalization beyond this problem,” he contends. “There is no radical ideology in Russia that poses a threat of global spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether ideological or not, the pattern is clear: Russia’s manpower crisis shows no sign of abating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <title>Why the High Seas Treaty Matters for Everyone</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/high-seas-treaty-why-it-matters-for-coastal-and-landlocked-countries-alike-by-arthur-peter-mutharika-2026-02</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Malawi became the first landlocked country to ratify the High Seas Treaty, it helped redefine what ocean stewardship looks like. The issue is not defined by proximity to the sea, but by a willingness to act in the common interest by safeguarding humanity’s shared life-support system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Trump Let Nuclear Arms Control Die</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The lapse of New START makes one thing clear: US President Donald Trump’s willingness to break commitments is a problem for the entire planet. Nuclear stability was built over decades by institutions designed to make the future legible, and now it is being unmade by a leader who sees no value in keeping his word.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
