      <title>Purpose-Built or Perilous: Congress Faces a Critical FBI Headquarters Decision</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/purpose-built-or-perilous-congress-faces-a-critical-fbi-headquarters-decision</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-library/washington-dc-united-states-february-20-federal-bureau-of-investigation-headquarters-logo-is-seen-in-washington-dc-united-s.jpg?id=65098297&amp;amp;width=980&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION –&lt;/strong&gt; Congress is weighing a decision with critical National Security implications for generations to come: where to locate the next FBI headquarters? The current headquarters, the Hoover Building, is long past its sell-by date, and there is general agreement it needs to be replaced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new headquarters, wherever it is located, must deal with a fundamental threat. It will inevitably be a high-priority target for terrorists, spies, and cyber criminals. That means the single most important consideration must be the safety of the men and women who work there; secondarily, the security of highly sensitive investigative and national security data held inside; lastly, the security of adjacencies - both human and physical. That kind of security requires more than a strong building. It requires a safe location to meet current and evolving threats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the frontrunner for the new headquarters fails those crucial considerations. We can do better--much better--than refurbishing the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center. The vulnerabilities have been known for over two decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April 19, 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City prompted new security measures for federal office buildings. Independent security consultants warned that the Reagan Building’s sprawling 11-Acre complex, mixed-use design, convention space, vast underground parking garage left it vulnerable to terrorist attacks. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks confirmed that the FBI needed a new headquarters complex - one that satisfied Interagency Security Committee (ISC) Level V protocols - the highest security standards for nonmilitary federal facilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A retrofit of the 30-year-old Reagan Building will fail to meet the physical and cybersecurity requirements of Level V. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Reagan Building is a quasi-public building in the heart of downtown Washington, DC, designed as a center for international events and public use. Its architecture is antithetical to Level V due to features such as a one-acre glass atrium roof, famed sky lights, and open access to surrounding buildings and Metro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The urban density of the Reagan Building surroundings creates permanent vulnerabilities that will never satisfy Level V Security. The Reagan Building is in the DC core, which exacerbates security risks to itself and adjacent federal and civilian activity: the District’s Wilson Building, Department of Commerce, Willard Hotel, Freedom Plaza, 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Street artery and in closer proximity to the White House. No amount of retrofitting will change these physical adjacencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearby high-rise buildings provide clear vantage points for hostile actors. The required standoff distances from blast threats can never be met. Nor can the Reagan Building adequately be shielded from line-of-sight surveillance, infrared detection, or electronic signal collection. And, the one acre of glass in the atrium skylight provides an easy drone threat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pedestrian tunnel under 14th Street, a popular food court, Metro access, and public garage connectivity undermine perimeter control, as well. Additionally, the Reagan Building cannot provide the square footage for the redundant power infrastructure mandated for a national security headquarters, including a separate utility plant and multiple independent grid connections. Moving FBI here shows a grave disregard for the safety and security of federal personnel, citizens, and national intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Real Tab: GSA’s FY 2026 prospectus estimates roughly $1.4 billion for design, construction, and FBI fit-out, but omit the costs of: temporary housing during construction, maintaining Level V-compliant interim facilities, and the likelihood of future leased space if full consolidation proves impossible within the fixed footprint of the Reagan Building. Outdated estimates and assumptions do not reflect the complexity of Level V security or the rapid evolution of cyber and surveillance threats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Time to Act is Now: Congress needs to remove the Reagan Building from consideration and insist on a purpose-built solution. The FBI needs a campus-style headquarters with adequate standoff distance, full perimeter control, redundant power and communications, and infrastructure flexible to adapt to evolving threats. Over 23 years ago, a bipartisan report was issued, using the attacks on the Murrah Building and World Trade Center as background, as well as GAO, DOJ/OIG, and Independent Security reports with similar conclusions. But nothing has happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since our first article appeared in &lt;em&gt;The Hill, &lt;/em&gt;Frank Keating, Oklahoma Governor at time of the Murrah Building Bombing, responded to us with, “The Murrah tragedy was a wake-up call. Now, thirty years later it doesn’t look like any lessons were learned.” A former Ambassador shared, “The State Department's post Benghazi worldwide building requirements are very unfriendly to retrofitting buildings for occupation by State personnel whether or not a SCIF is involved. The Bureau will be the target like the Marines in Beirut.”&lt;/p&gt;If lawmakers want to ensure the FBI remains the world’s premier law enforcement and counterterrorism organization, they should demand a headquarters that is purposefully built from a national security perspective, not a retrofit of a building never intended to be a secured facility. Let’s, finally, do this right&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rather than indulging in anti-immigration culture wars and tarring Britain as a case study in &quot;civilizational erasure,&quot; Donald Trump and his followers’ would do well to examine how Britain struggled with the loss of its own global preeminence. No other country’s recent past better represents America’s possible future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Positional bargaining might work for real-estate transactions, but it is woefully ill-suited to complex diplomatic challenges. Negotiations like those over the Ukraine war and Iran’s nuclear ambitions should aim not to settle the terms of a one-off exchange, but to build a framework that can shape and manage future developments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With major donor countries slashing their foreign-aid budgets, the financial foundations of global health have come under strain, revealing structural weaknesses long masked by steady public funding. The solution lies in building a more resilient system that combines grants, concessional loans, and private capital.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For more than two centuries, time has been capitalism’s organizing principle, structuring wages, contracts, and collective action. But AI has made human time functionally abundant, undermining that foundation and fracturing labor into three incompatible regimes no single legal system can reconcile.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As countries scramble to secure the minerals needed for clean energy, digital technologies, AI, and defense industries, the new era of resource competition implies both great promise and grave peril.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With both the Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and more genteel post-liberal commentators calling for their own religious views to be imposed on others, traditional conservatives and Christians must speak up. The state has no business using coercion in matters of conscience, as the Catholic Church itself has long made clear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Trump Gets Wrong About Corruption and Business</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As US President Donald Trump’s pay-to-play approach to politics blurs the line between legal and illegal, businesses may feel pressured to go along. But decades of evidence show that corruption raises capital costs, depresses growth, distorts incentives, and ultimately hardens into strategic decay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What the Latest Policy and Tech Shifts Mean for National Security</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/tech-national-security-policy</link>
      <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to &lt;strong&gt;The Iron Triangle&lt;/strong&gt;, the Cipher Brief column serving Procurement Officers tasked with buying the future, Investors funding the next generation of defense technology, and the Policy Wonks analyzing its impact on the global order.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;COLUMN/EXPERT PERSPECTIVE — &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This issue explores the massive, simultaneous shifts in Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) authorities, funding, and technological requirements. Pentagon Procurement Officers are realizing that the drone market is evolving so rapidly that buying isolated, legacy C-UAS systems is a strategic liability. Policy wonks are watching the fundamental shift in legal and operational frameworks governing domestic and military airspace from a defensive, heavily restricted posture to a proactive one. For investors, the recent shifts mean there are unprecedented market opportunities driven by hard deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Procurement Officers: The Death of Standalone Electronic Warfare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional technologies such as Electronic Warfare (EW) aren’t going to do the job. In complex or urban environments, traditional EW suffers several technical challenges (multipath propagation, electromagnetic clutter) and is dangerous (interfering with civilian emergency channels). Furthermore, EW probably won’t work against modern drones. Many are increasingly equipped with tech that enables autonomous operation, often without RF emissions, rendering simple jamming useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of varying rules of engagement and collateral damage risks, C-UAS must be a spectrum of responses. This includes non-kinetic (cyber interference, GNSS spoofing) and kinetic (directed-energy, interceptors) options seamlessly controlled by a single architecture. Everything from detection and airspace deconfliction, to UAS defeat must be fast, precise, and integrated. No pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaming between multiple complementary defense technology companies should be highly encouraged, if not required, to reduce or remove the burden of innovation from the government client. Procurement can then pivot to integrated, end-to-end architectures. No single vendor can create a system able to counter the entirety of today’s threats, much less the threats that emerge before your next&lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.gov&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sam.gov&lt;/a&gt; solicitation can get published. Shifting toward rapid procurement mechanisms and away from long-term, winner-take-all contracts will help quickly replace any technologies that fail to perform as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have deep experience in national security and something to say? Drop us a note at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@thecipherbrief.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;info@thecipherbrief.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Policy Wonks: The Bureaucratic Shackles Are Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of War's (DoW) December 2025 policy lets commanders go lethal fast. The policy represents a massive culture shift, explicitly empowering commanders to extend defensive actions beyond the physical fence line of military installations. Redundant engagement zones have been simplified into just Zones 1 and 2, giving wider decision-making space based on the totality of circumstances rather than overly prescriptive engagement criteria that would otherwise delay responses and increase risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive actions have recognized that the UAS threat is no longer a foreign battlefield problem; it is a homeland security crisis driven by cartels smuggling fentanyl, criminals surveilling law enforcement, and foreign actors targeting critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat this, the White House has mandated the FAA to provide automated, real-time access to personal identifying information associated with UAS remote identification signals to both federal and local agencies, breaking down long-standing privacy and jurisdictional silos. Yes, the government is watching you, Mr. UAS pilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Investors: A Massive, Time-Sensitive Market Expansion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple, complementary catalysts for C-UAS spending, representing a windfall of opportunities for viable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House has mandated that federal grant programs be opened up to allow State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial agencies to purchase UAS detection and tracking equipment. This instantly expands the C-UAS customer base beyond the Pentagon to thousands of local police departments and municipal governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government is establishing a National Training Center for Counter-UAS specifically to build capacity for major upcoming events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the military side, the DoW is not waiting for an incident; they have mandated that installation commanders issue new, aggressive installation-specific operating procedures within 60 days, forcing immediate assessments of vulnerabilities and driving urgent procurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment firms should hire due diligence teams who know what they’re looking at. Defense technology companies aren’t usually being purposefully deceptive about their solution’s efficacy; they are convinced they can make it work like their pitch decks claim. Finally, be sure your due diligence team sees the technology perform before the boss wires the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unrestricted C-UAS era has arrived, and the &quot;Iron Triangle&quot; of procurement, policy, and investment must move in lockstep to meet it. With the Department of War slashing bureaucratic red tape and the White House opening federal coffers to local agencies, the market is no longer just expanding, it’s exploding (pun intended). Whether you are a commander securing a base or an investor vetting the next interceptor, the mandate is to move fast, integrate everything, and prioritize results over pitch decks. Success in this new landscape requires a proactive posture and a healthy dose of skepticism toward standalone solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; on YouTube?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US Supreme Court’s ruling on Donald Trump’s tariffs may modify the legal facade of US trade policy, as well as produce a brief surge of imports into the United States. But, ultimately, it is unlikely to reduce the overall height or significantly alter the country composition of US trade barriers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Where crime and terror meet: Australia’s illicit tobacco market</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/australias-illicit-tobacco-market</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION – &lt;/strong&gt;The unearthing of IRGC’s involvement in Australia’s firebombing incidents in 2025 has subsequently brought into question - the extent by which overseas terrorist groups and Australian domestic organized crime are in sinister collaboration. Although the firebombings occurred in 2025, the facilitation of terrorist financing by the efforts of criminal proceeds have long been understood. With illicit tobacco being a staple and incredibly lucrative commodity in the Australian criminal underworld, spurred by the nation’s expensive excise tax, its profound role in terrorist financing is a pressing issue for Australia to further investigate, especially in light of the IRGC discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From late 2024, Australia experienced a series of arson attacks against Jewish-affiliated enterprises, of which two were linked to the IRGC by the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) in August 2025. The&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/30/what-do-we-know-about-the-antisemitic-attacks-in-australia-allegedly-orchestrated-by-iran-ntwnfb&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;first incident&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; involved a firebomb attack on the Lewis Continental Kitchen in Sydney in October 2024 coordinated by Sayed Mohammad Moosawi, a former chief of the Nomads motorcycle gang. The&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/27/second-melbourne-man-charged-over-arson-attack-adass-israel-synagogue-faces-court-ntwnfb&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;second incident&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; involved a firebomb attack on Adass Israel Synagogue in December 2024, which resulted in over $20 million in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, ASIO head Mike Burgess pinned the attacks on the IRGC,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/how-asio-cracked-the-code-and-found-out-iran-was-plotting-attacks-on-australias-jewish-community/news-story/cf776ef2a199d2886de157dfd16c7f6d?amp&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;attesting that the group utilized proxies to operationalize these attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, the IRGC has been listed as a terrorist entity by other Western states, namely Canada and the United States. While the attacks did not ultimately result in terrorism charges in Australia, the IRGC’s involvement would shed light on the looming&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ass/article/view/6218&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;crime-terror nexus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the symbiotic relationship between terrorism and organized crime that is festering in the nation. Understanding this interplay of crime and terror is crucial for counterterrorism efforts in Australia to proactively deter the future threat of terrorism on their soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the illicit tobacco market has been a rampant issue in Australia, with an economy of&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-04/illegal-tobacco-is-a-deadly-10-billion-industry/105607186&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;approximately $10 billion annually&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The market is propagated by the nation’s expensive excise tax on tobacco which compels users to turn to illegal avenues to procure the commodity, ultimately driving the lucrative underground market even further. At&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/gst-excise-and-indirect-taxes/tobacco-and-excise/excise-duty-rates-for-tobacco&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;A$1.49 per 0.8 gram stick, increased in September 2025&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;a href=&quot;https://tobaccoinsider.com/australia-tobacco-market/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;A$40, or US$26&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a pack of 20 cigarettes, the prices of tobacco is exorbitant compared to other Western countries such as Canada at an&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/edrates/excise-duty-rates.html#Excise_duty_on_stamped_tobacco&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;excise duty rate of CAD$0.19 per stick&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smoke-free.ca/pdf_1/taxrates.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;an “average” pack costing between CAD$15.36 to $19.75&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as of April 2025. In addition to an&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-25/illegal-tobacco-trade-costing-budget-billions/105095236&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;estimated loss of $7 billion in excise revenue&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this illicit market is known to facilitate terrorist financing operations,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acic.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases-and-statements/media-statement-illicit-tobacco&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;being listed as a substantial financier to offshore terrorist groups&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the Australia Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC). In relation to the firebombing attacks, the discovered crime-terror ties is a warning for Australian stakeholders to address the nation’s excise tax policy which would, in turn, strategically cripple terrorist financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further linkage between illicit tobacco and terrorist financing has been discovered by Australian authorities. Prior to the two firebomb attacks between 2024 and 2025, Australia had already been experiencing a long string of firebomb attacks, linked to illicit tobacco kingpin, Kazem “Kaz” Hamad. Hamad, who was deported from Australia to Iraq in 2023, was believed to be involved with 150 arson attacks targeting tobacco shops across Melbourne. Notably, he was linked to the arson attack on the Lux nightclub in November 2024 where perpetrators of the incident drove a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afr.com/policy/foreign-affairs/how-asio-linked-iran-to-adass-synagogue-attack-20250826-p5mq1l&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;blue Volkswagen Golf&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. According to&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/man-charged-connection-theft-vehicle-used-melbourne-synagogue-arson&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;a joint report by the Australia Federal Police (AFP), the ASIO, and the Victoria Police&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the same vehicle was allegedly used in the Adass Israel synagogue firebombing and a shooting in Bundoora, both of which happened on the same night. Given this linkage, the IRGC may be a key benefactor to the Hamad’s affluent illicit tobacco trade while members of his criminal network will commit violence to appease this overseas client of theirs. By leveraging these networks, the IRGC can employ an outsourcing approach to inflict damage on adversaries while maintaining a guise of plausible deniability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRGC’s methodology, which is a form of hybrid, or asymmetrical, warfare, is a staple in the organization’s playbook which has been observed before in its&lt;a href=&quot;https://ceylontoday.lk/2024/11/11/arugam-bay-attack-mastermind-and-operators/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;plan to attack targets in Sri Lanka and the United States in 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The IRGC utilized drug trafficker Farhad Shakeri, who held a strong network of organized criminals in both Sri Lanka and the U.S. Shakeri planned to use his criminal contacts to bomb the Israel consulate in Colombo and Arugam Bay, assassinate Israeli tourists in both locations, and also assassinate President Donald Trump in the U.S simultaneously during the first anniversary of Hamas’ 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. However, his plans were later thwarted by law enforcement and intelligence communities of both Sri Lanka and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the discovery of the IRGC involvement, the Albanese government&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2025/08/28/following-australian-proscription-time-to-tighten-the-terrorism-sanctions-noose-on-the-irgc/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;removed the Iranian ambassador from the country&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; along with the suspension of its embassy in August 2025 while finally listing the IRGC as&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foreignminister.gov.au/minister/penny-wong/media-release/response-iranian-attacks&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;a terrorist entity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Operationally, this new designation may bolster the Five Eyes’ information sharing with Australia while granting the nation a legal framework to pursue terrorism charges against IRGC-affiliated activity. Additionally, Australia has ramped up its law enforcement efforts to dismantle the illicit tobacco market. New sets of laws have been implemented in 2025 by&lt;a href=&quot;https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/102596&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Queensland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.health.nsw.gov.au:443/news/Pages/20250727_00.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;New South Wales&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tackle illicit tobacco operations along with drug busts such as in&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-31/qld-historic-tobacco-vape-cigarette-bust/105717320&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Operation Xray Modred&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which led to the seizure of approximately $53.8 million worth of tobacco across 17 different storage facilities. The operation is regarded as one of the largest busts in Queensland history. Overall, Australia’s stringent measures and due diligence in crippling the illicit tobacco market demonstrates its strong commitment to reduce criminality and terrorism alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while enforcement efforts are effective, it is paramount for Australia to consider policy changes to tobacco excise to not only reduce user dependence on illegal sources but cull domestic terrorist financing operations. One policy option that has been discussed by the nation’s largest tobacco wholesalers was to temporarily&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/big-tobacco-calls-for-tax-freeze-to-combat-black-market-ciggies-20250316-p5ljy7&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;freeze&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the increase in tobacco prices. Doing so would create a window for government and law enforcement to deliberate on viable solutions while preventing the situation from worsening. Reduction of excise may lead to complications such as a potential drop in fiscal budget. However, given the tremendous loss of revenue due to the black market as discussed, conversion of illegitimate users to legitimate users as a result of improved policy may create fiscal opportunities for the Australian government instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, preventing tobacco use may contribute to the reduction of the illicit market which does not require touching excise tax. Through a whole-of-society approach such as anti-tobacco education or promotion of healthy lifestyles, Australia may minimize the demand for illegitimate procurement of the product, thus inadvertently mitigating the terrorist financing problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRGC’s asymmetrical operations in the Australian firebombing incidents emphasize the ever-present need for counterterrorism and national security stakeholders to employ criminological perspectives to unravel the crime-terror nexus. It must be understood that terrorism does not begin with an attack, but rather an established logistical and financial foundation before that. Given organized crime groups’ vast access to lucrative contraband such as illicit tobacco in the case of Australia, terrorist organizations will utilize them for financing opportunities. Given this, restricting distribution of illicit markets will result in considerable mileage in counterterrorism efforts. As crime and terror become a conjoined threat, law enforcement and national security efforts must be just as, if not more, collectivized to counteract them. Australia must not only rely on domestic enforcement efforts and foreign policy decisions to cripple the capability of nefarious actors, but also curb the demand for the rampant illicit tobacco market by changing to its excise tax policies and discouraging product usage.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today's world, defense spending matters, and increased military investment is a legitimate policy response to security threats. But without parallel investment in development, it is only half a security strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as established corporations facing challenges from innovative startups must adapt or die, militaries must continually renew themselves to remain effective against emerging threats. For democracies today, this means investing in evolving technologies and embracing new ways of operating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revisionist History – Aliens, Secrets and Conspiracies</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/revisionist-history-aliens</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION –&lt;/strong&gt; Over a decade ago, I was a public official and was at one of our commission meetings on the coast of California. A fellow commissioner and I decided to take a long lunchtime walk along the coast. As we chatted, we realized we had both worked on several of the same very classified programs. His involvement was in acquisition and finance, while mine was more deeply connected to the engineering development of the project and hands-on with the operators on site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Got Our Advanced Technology From Aliens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;While we both were discreet about not talking about specifics, we recognized the projects we had worked on. So you can imagine my surprise when he turned to me and casually said, “You know this technology came from aliens.” I laughed, thinking that obviously he must be joking. But as we continued walking he continued on, claiming, “You know the equipment you worked on and stuff that followed came from our secret alien investigation site at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.military.com/off-duty/2020/12/18/6-urban-legends-about-wright-patterson-air-force-base.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wright Patterson Air Force Base&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. All we did was reverse engineer Alien technology.” This time I stopped in my tracks and looked at him to see if he was smiling. I was puzzled as he looked dead serious. He explained that there was no possible way we could be doing what we were doing using existing technology. Before I changed the subject I asked him how he knew this, he replied with absolute sincerity, “I was head of acquisition on the program. I was briefed on the project. That’s what they told us and they swore us to secrecy.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really didn’t know how to process this. He was really a smart and level-headed guy. In fact he was the mayor at the time of Rancho Palos Verde. It took me a mile or two into our walk to rethink everything I knew about the project (even then it had been in decades past), including having sat with a few of the engineers (some strange, but not aliens) as they were designing the system (with me trying to keep up with the revised blueprints in document control), and then watching the system being built and assembled. While it had required incredibly creative engineering, and applying technology on a scale so massive no commercial company could afford it, this system was built by smart people with no aliens involved. But he was equally convinced they were. Over our time together on the commission we took more walks, had lots more to talk about, but we never broached the subject again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, for the next few years, I puzzled on how he could have been so sure of something that I was sure was completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Did Tell Them It Was Aliens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Fast forward 15 years, and my world view of that conversation was upended when I read in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/ufo-us-disinformation-45376f7e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the Department of Defense had been running a disinformation campaign, briefing finance and acquisition people that the technology for these classified programs &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; coming from aliens. (Take a minute and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/ufo-us-disinformation-45376f7e&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;read the article&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden our coast-side conversation from a decade and a half ago made sense to me. Most of our most compartmentalized programs have different levels of what was called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_to_know&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;need to know&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” I never paid much attention as I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_access_program&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;read all the way into&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the technical and operational details of these programs. I vaguely knew that others got fewer details, but as I was just discovering, &lt;em&gt;others had received active disinformation&lt;/em&gt;. In a few cases, security officers were even using fake photos and documents to create the Alien cover-story for secret-weapons programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out my fellow commissioner had been briefed by the U.S. government that it was Aliens, and he went to his grave believing it so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you going to believe me or your lying eyes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;What’s interesting is what happened after the news came out that the Alien story was government disinformation. A large percentage of people who were briefed, now “doubled down” and believed “we got the technology from Aliens” even more strongly – believing the new information itself was a coverup. Many dismissed the facts by prioritizing how they felt over reality, something we often see in political or religious contexts. (“Are you going to believe me or your lying eyes?”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wondered how my friend would have reacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secrecy, Disinformation, and a Higher Power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;While on its face this is an amusing story about secrecy, it’s really about the intersection of the secrecy’s impact on society and its role in misinformation, manipulation, the creation of cynicism and mistrust, and our need to believe in a higher power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manipulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;An example of secrecy used for manipulation in the 20th century was when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/article/opening-the-venona-files/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Security Agency Venona &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;project &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venona_project&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;unmasked Soviet spies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. Even though this was one of the nation’s most secret programs, the FBI leaked its findings to Joe McCarthy and Richard Nixon. They used this classified knowledge to manipulate the American public, fueling McCarthyism and Richard Nixon’s career. 50 years later, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsa.gov/Helpful-Links/NSA-FOIA/Declassification-Transparency-Initiatives/Historical-Releases/Venona/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Venona&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was made public historians substantively revised the history of U.S. Cold War politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 21st century Social Media misinformation (e.g. Chinese and Russian influence campaigns, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qanon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; conspiracies) will look like toys next to the AI-driven manipulation that’s about to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cynicism and mistrust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Secrecy created 75 years of cynicism and mistrust, when the U.S. began launching highly classified reconnaissance balloons (story &lt;a href=&quot;https://steveblank.com/2010/01/28/balloon-wars/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and later the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes. These top secret projects gave rise to decades of UFO sightings. Instead of acknowledging these sightings were from classified military projects the Department of Defense issued cover stories (“you saw weather balloons”) that weren’t believable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments and companies have always kept secrets and used misinformation and manipulation. However, things stay secret way too long – for many reasons – some reasonable (we’re still using the same methods – reconnaissance technology, tradecraft, or, it would harm people still alive – retired spies, etc) or not so reasonable (we broke U.S. or international laws – &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;COINTELPRO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or it would embarrass us or our allies – Kennedy assassination, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein_files&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Epstein files&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secrecy increases the odds of conspiracy beliefs. Because evidence can’t be checked, contradictions can’t be audited, a government “cover-up” becomes a plausible explanation. People don’t tolerate “I don’t know” for long when stakes are high (stolen elections, identity, national crises, the meaning of life, or what happens when we die). That vacuum gets filled by the most emotionally satisfying model: a hidden “higher power” concealing information and controlling events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Just as social media replaced traditional news sources, AI-driven summaries of current events are likely to replace our understanding of the world around us. What happens to trust when AI manipulates human’s tendency to embrace conspiracy theories? Who will define the truth in the brave new world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And by the way, I’m still pretty sure we didn’t get it from Aliens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece was originally published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://steveblank.com/2026/02/10/revisionist-history-aliens-secrets-and-conspiracies/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Steve Blank here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://steveblank.com/2026/02/10/revisionist-history-aliens-secrets-and-conspiracies/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://steveblank.com/2026/02/10/revisionist-history-aliens-secrets-and-conspiracies/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who's reading this? 500K+ dedicated national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump’s fixation on Somali immigrants is not arbitrary; it is part of a broader campaign to demonize non-white immigrants as criminals and civilizational threats. But that narrative depends on ignorance of Somali integration and of America’s own role in Somalia’s collapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US Supreme Court has ruled that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are unconstitutional, effectively positioning the rule of law as the ultimate arbiter of a terrible economic policy. This sends an important message: US policies may not be personalized by the whims of a vindictive and uninformed wannabe autocrat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Russia’s War Effort Signals Strategic Decline</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russias-war-ukraine</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION —&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Despite claims of battlefield momentum in Ukraine, the data shows that Russia is paying an extraordinary price for minimal gains and is in decline as a major power. Since February 2022, Russian forces have suffered nearly 1.2 million casualties, more losses than any major power in any war since World War II…After seizing the initiative in 2024, Russian forces have advanced at an average rate of between 15 and 70 meters per day in their most prominent offensives, slower than almost any major offensive campaign in any war in the last century. Meanwhile, Russia’s war economy is under mounting strain, with manufacturing declining, slowing growth of 0.6 percent in 2025, and no globally competitive technology firms to help drive long-term productivity.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a quote from &lt;em&gt;Russia’s Grinding War in Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;, a Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) analysis brief by Seth G. Jones and Riley McCabe, released January 27, which says that “a close look at the data suggests that Russia is hardly winning [its war against Ukraine],” and, even more interestingly, that “Russia is increasingly a declining power.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones, President of CSIS’ Defense and Security Department, and McCabe, Associate Fellow in CSIS’, Warfare, Irregular Threats, and Terrorism Program, not only assess that “Russia’s overall progress on the battlefield, especially in the last two years, fall decisively short of Moscow’s goal to militarily conquer Ukraine,” but also that “Russia’s economy is showing signs of strain, and long-term productivity looks bleak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the Jones/McCabe analysis of the military situation and below look at their view of Moscow’s economic situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While saying assessing casualties and fatalities in wartime is difficult and imprecise, and various sides have incentives to inflate or shrink the numbers for political purposes, Jones/McCabe write that “According to CSIS estimates, Russian forces suffered nearly 1.2 million battlefield casualties, which include killed, wounded, and missing, between February 2022 and December 2025…There were roughly 415,000 Russian casualties in 2025 alone, with an average of nearly 35,000 casualties per month. In addition, there were roughly 275,000 to 325,000 Russian battlefield fatalities between February 2022 and December 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the past, the CSIS analysis showed, “Russian battlefield fatalities in Ukraine are more than 17 times greater than Soviet fatalities in Afghanistan during the 1980s, 11 times greater than during Russia’s First and Second Chechen Wars in the 1990s and 2000s, respectively, and over five times greater than all Russian and Soviet wars &lt;em&gt;combined&lt;/em&gt; since World War II.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CSIS team attributes the high Russian casualties and fatalities to such things as “Russia’s failure to effectively conduct combined arms and joint warfare, poor tactics and training, corruption, low morale, and Ukraine’s effective defense-in-depth strategy in a war that favors the defense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically the CSIS analysis says, “Russia’s attrition strategy has accepted the costs of high casualties in hopes of eventually wearing down Ukraine’s military and society. On the battlefield, Russia has utilized dismounted infantry to wear down and attrit Ukrainian lines, along with small first-person view (FPV) drones, artillery, glide bombs, and other stand-off weapons. Russian units have routinely conducted advances using small squads of troops, often poorly trained, that are supported by armored vehicles or light mobility vehicles. Higher Russian headquarters frequently order these forces to advance toward Ukrainian positions to conduct reconnaissance by drawing fire. If Ukrainian positions are positively identified, Russian soldiers may be sent forward to attack positions, which are further mapped and then targeted with artillery, FPV drones, and glide bombs. These tactics have led to high fatalities and casualties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine side is also given credit for “their defense-in-depth strategy in a war that has largely favored the defender. Ukraine has used trenches, dragon’s teeth (anti-tank obstacles), mines, and other barriers—along with artillery and drones—to attrit advancing Russian soldiers and vehicles. The eastern front line, for instance, continues to be saturated with drones. As a result, vehicle movement is difficult within 15 kilometers of the front line. Infantry soldiers must instead march to their positions for 10 to 15 kilometers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One result has been Russia’s slow rate of advance. According to the CSIS analysis, “Russia’s gains since it took the initiative in January 2024 are far smaller than the large territorial shifts seen earlier in the war. At the peak of the initial invasion in March 2022, Russian forces seized roughly 115,000 square kilometers in less than five weeks, but by April 2022, Ukraine had retaken more than 35,000 square kilometers. By November 2022, Ukraine had retaken approximately 75,000 square kilometers, including through successful counteroffensives around [the Ukraine cities] Kharkiv and Kherson.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Russian economy has held up better than expected following U.S. and other Western country sanctions imposed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, strain on its economy is starting to show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CSIS analysis says, “In 2025, Russian manufacturing declined at its fastest rate since March 2022, with contractions in output and new orders, a rising labor shortage, and a decrease in input buying.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Overall, Russian manufacturing suffered seven consecutive months of contraction in 2025, with production levels declining for ten consecutive months. In addition, consumer demand weakened and inflation was high.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jone/McCabe write there is also a labor crunch, a drop in oil revenues with lower global prices, with 2025 economic growth slowing to 0.6 percent, while the International Monetary Fund estimates that Russia’s growth would remain slow, at 0.8 percent, in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CSIS team also says Russia faces a capital problem. Unable to borrow on international markets, the Kremlin has borrowed at home and raised taxes to finance the Ukraine war. Roughly half its budget is spent on the armed forces, the military-industrial complex, domestic security, and debt service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the war sustains jobs and industrial activity,” the CSIS team says, “it produces few lasting assets or productivity gains. Higher taxes burden the civilian economy, which is already suffering from double-digit interest rates and significant labor shortages. Tank factories are working overtime, but automobile producers have cut shifts.” Ammunition, uniforms, and fortifications contribute to current GDP, but they do not improve long-term welfare or capital formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Jones/McCabe, “Russia also faces one of the most severe demographic challenges among major economies, with a shrinking and aging population, low birth rate, high mortality rate (especially among working-age men), and high rate of emigration among skilled workers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example where the CSIS analysis finds Russia falling behind is in Artificial Intelligence (AI). It points out that Russian President Vladimir Putin once predicted, “Artificial intelligence is the future not only of Russia but of all of mankind. . . . Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.”&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;But it then states, “Russia today is a bottom-tier AI power. It ranks 28 of 36 countries in the overall strength and development of its AI ecosystem—or AI ‘vibrancy’ -- according to Stanford University. The top-performing Russian AI model trails even older iterations of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse, not a single Russian company is among the top 100 technology companies in the world by market capitalization, while the U.S. leads the pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the space race, where Russia was once a leader, Roscosmos, the state corporation in charge of the Russian space program, carried out only 17 orbital launches in 2025, according to the CSIS analysis. That compares to 193 U.S. orbital launches and 92 by China. Russia’s space industry also suffered an accident in December 2025 that caused severe damage to the launch pad Russia uses for sending astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station. In addition, a 2018 Soyuz rocket carrying two astronauts failed as it headed to space; the emergency abort system carried the two to safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has also been a decline inside Russia in popular support inside Russia for the war. According to polls cited by CSIS, in May 2023, 57 percent of Russians believed that most people in their inner social circle supported the war, compared to 39 percent who opposed the war. By October 2025, 55 percent of Russians in their inner social circle opposed the war, compared to 45 who supported the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All thi, however, has not appeared to have affected Putin, who, according to the Jones.McCabe analysis “remains undeterred by the high casualty and fatality rates, and Russia’s economic downturn is unlikely to bring the Kremlin to the negotiating table—at least on terms that would be acceptable to Ukraine or Europe.” They say, “Putin may be willing to accept the high casualty and fatality numbers because most of these soldiers are from such regions as the Far East and North Caucasus—and not politically vital areas for him, such as Moscow and St. Petersburg.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Jones/McCabe analysis finds, “President Putin and the Russian government have been adept in conducting an aggressive disinformation campaign that has convinced some policymakers, including in Washington, that Russian victory is inevitable, despite substantial evidence to the contrary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CSIS team attributes that to Russia having “boosted its funding for state-run media in 2026 by roughly 54 percent, indicating a commitment to intensified information warfare. The Kremlin’s propaganda machine is designed to sustain domestic support for the regime and its war against Ukraine, as well as to convince key foreign audiences that the war has been successful and needs to continue.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developing countries would be wise to pursue deliberate sequencing before embracing automation. That is because embedding AI in fragmented and outdated administrative systems and sectors with stagnant productivity will most likely eliminate middle-skill jobs without creating new engines of growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The lack of basic tools to track and understand housing has resulted in a patchwork of individual programs and little clarity on whether any of them meet basic access and affordability needs.

      <title>Building the Talent Pipeline for America’s Security Future</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/talent-pipeline</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION –&lt;/strong&gt; Public service, at its core, is bigger than government service alone. Serving one’s country takes many forms, and in a time when the&lt;a href=&quot;http://pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/01/07/what-the-data-says-about-federal-workers/#how-many-federal-workers-are-there&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;federal workforce&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is shrinking, recognizing the breadth of these opportunities is critical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my roles as an adjunct at Texas A&amp;amp;M’s&lt;a href=&quot;http://bush.tamu.edu/DC/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Bush School&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an alumni council member at the University of Denver’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://korbel.du.edu/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Korbel School&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a contributing alumnus at the University of Southern California’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://uscgpi.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Global Policy Institute&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I find myself fielding an increasing number of students who are grappling with how to navigate the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been here before. After the Cold War, the so-called “peace dividend” led to&lt;a href=&quot;https://wagner.nyu.edu/files/performance/True%20Size%20Research%20Brief.pdf#:~:text=Although%20most%20of%20the%20decline%20involved%20little,administration%20eventually%20meet%20and%20exceed%20its%20reinventing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;reductions across government&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, yet the need for talented, dedicated individuals remained. Today, too, the demand is high, and the pool of students and young professionals&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/attracting-gen-z-talent-into-us-public-service&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;aspiring to serve&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; their country is deep. The three universities that have invested in me also continue to invest in carving paths for students to serve in a wide range of roles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government&lt;/strong&gt; itself is the most traditional route. Agencies may be smaller than in the past, yet as the senior generation transitions out,&lt;a href=&quot;https://natsec.usajobs.gov/search/results/?cmco=NatSec&amp;amp;s=relevance&amp;amp;sd=asc&amp;amp;p=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;opportunities abound&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, a cursory look reveals many are hiring. Working at the state and local level opens the aperture even wider; I worked for the state of Colorado and interned for the state of California well before I landed at the CIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching&lt;/strong&gt;, at any level, is an invaluable public service. Educators cultivate the next generation of thinkers, leaders, and professionals, shaping civic knowledge and analytic capacity that are foundational to democratic governance and national security. By equipping students with “&lt;a href=&quot;https://natsec.usajobs.gov/search/results/?cmco=NatSec&amp;amp;s=relevance&amp;amp;sd=asc&amp;amp;p=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;deeper learning&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” such as reasoning, problem-solving, and even persistence, teachers cultivate civic-mindedness and ensure that public service endures across generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonprofits&lt;/strong&gt; also play a vital role. Whether focused on development, security, human rights, environmental protection, or public health, these organizations&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2024/nonprofits-accounted-for-12-8-million-jobs-9-9-percent-of-private-sector-employment-in-2022.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;employ millions of people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to perform roles that neither the market nor the government can fulfill. Serving in the nonprofit sector often requires ingenuity, resourcefulness, and a commitment to mission-driven work—traits that translate well into national security challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International organizations&lt;/strong&gt; provide a global platform for public service. From the United Nations to regional alliances, these institutions facilitate cooperation, conflict resolution, humanitarian response, and development programs. Working in such settings&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schiller.edu/blog/the-value-of-international-work-experience-in-a-globalized-world/#:~:text=Gaining%20Unique%20Professional%20Skills:%20International,and%20resilience%20are%20increasingly%20valued.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;develops core skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including diplomacy, cross-cultural communication, and policy expertise, all of which are transferable to domestic roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think tanks&lt;/strong&gt; offer another avenue for impactful service. Analysts and researchers at these institutions produce rigorous, evidence-based insights that&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brussels-school.be/research/publications/beyond-unhelpful-metaphors-influence-think-tanks-us-foreign-and-national&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;influence government policy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, public debate, and strategic planning, particularly in national security and foreign affairs. Think tanks combine scholarship with real-world impact, allowing professionals to shape the discourse on pressing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt; provides opportunities that are increasingly essential to national security. Since joining&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leidos.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Leidos&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a Director and Account Manager in our Intelligence Sector, I have been humbled by colleagues who dedicate their careers to advancing technology and capabilities that the government cannot, and should not, develop on its own. Furthermore,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/insights/public-sector/enhancing-national-security-with-public-private-partnerships.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;public-private partnerships&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are critical to maintaining US technological and security advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Attributes Open the Way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our emerging professionals should cultivate a combination of skills, knowledge, and character to pave the way for any of these careers. Excellence, deep expertise, and technology acumen are pillars, particularly as workplace challenges grow more complex and technologically driven. While opinions vary on the most critical traits for young professionals entering public service, I have consistently found a core set of skills and behaviors that open doors to careers. I call them the &lt;strong&gt;Five Cs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Thinking&lt;/strong&gt; is perhaps the most foundational skill. Critical thinking is learnable, and educational research shows that structured analysis and&lt;a href=&quot;https://purdueglobalwriting.center/writing-to-think/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;disciplined writing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are among the most effective ways to develop it. A well-reasoned, well-substantiated paper forces the author to evaluate evidence, challenge assumptions, and construct persuasive arguments—exactly the habits that public service demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication&lt;/strong&gt;, both written and oral, is inseparable from professional effectiveness. Studies consistently demonstrate that&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2025/05/14/why-communication-skills-are-your-most-valuable-career-asset/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;strong communication skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; correlate with leadership, policy influence, and organizational success.13 Today, AI tools can assist with drafting, but understanding what makes communication compelling remains a human responsibility—one that requires being able to explain &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; something works, not merely that it does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2024/01/28/70-of-employers-say-creative-thinking-is-most-in-demand-skill-in-2024/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;enables professionals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to solve novel and ill-structured problems. Research on innovation in public organizations shows that creative thinking improves adaptability and problem-solving in complex environments, including national security contexts. Future public servants can nurture creativity through interdisciplinary exposure, experimentation, and tolerance for intellectual risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curiosity&lt;/strong&gt; drives learning, adaptability, and sustained professional growth. Educational and cognitive&lt;a href=&quot;https://robertsmith.com/blog/the-role-of-curiosity-in-career-growth-and-lifelong-learning/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;research links curiosity to deeper knowledge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; acquisition, improved performance, and long-term expertise development. In a field defined by evolving threats, curiosity is not optional—it is a professional obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt; is essential in environments where no single individual or institution holds all the answers. Organizational&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/655436/collaboration-at-work.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;research consistently shows&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that collaborative teams outperform individuals when addressing complex, high-stakes problems. Collaboration transforms individual competence into collective effectiveness, a cornerstone of public service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the US Government.

      <title>The Cognitive Battlefield is Now Decisive Terrain</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-cognitive-battlefield-is-now-decisive-terrain</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION --&lt;/strong&gt; Senior policymakers, military leaders, technologists and narrative strategists had one thing on their minds as they gathered in a Reston &lt;a href=&quot;https://information-professionals.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinnacle_2026_Agenda_10Feb2026.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;conference room&lt;/a&gt; last week - how decision advantage, psychological leverage, and narrative dominance are increasingly capable of determining strategic outcomes. Cognitive warfare - once treated as an adjunct to cyber or information operations - is becoming a primary instrument of power and the implications are profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clausewitz wrote that the center of gravity in war is the source of an adversary’s strength. In today’s environment, that center of gravity is increasingly ideological and psychological. Unity and will - both domestic and allied - are strategic assets. Information is not merely a supporting function. It’s a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contest unfolding in the gray zone is fundamentally about narrative. Not propaganda in the blunt Cold War sense, but sustained, cumulative influence campaigns that shape how populations interpret reality. These efforts operate across media, social platforms, text messaging networks, gaming environments, and increasingly, AI-driven platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtle Corrosion Beats Spectacular Attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important insights shared last week centered on the cycle of desensitization. Consider the steady drumbeat of cyber intrusions attributed to China or Russia. Each incident sparks temporary outrage, but repetition normalizes the activity. Over time, the public and sometimes policymakers, stop reacting. Strategic corrosion sets in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is cognitive attrition. It does not rely on a single catastrophic blow. Instead, it leverages small, atmospheric messages that accumulate. A fabricated report of a measles outbreak in Ukraine, spread via text messages. Repeated claims that Western institutions are corrupt or incompetent. False narratives injected into local conversations. Individually trivial. Collectively transformative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cumulative effect resembles what some participants described as a “cognitive supply chain”- disinformation introduced through multiple channels, actors, and devices over time, reinforcing itself until it feels like truth. In this environment, the question is not simply whether a narrative is false. It is whether the repetition of that narrative alters perception faster than truth can catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If traditional principles of war emphasize mass and maneuver, today’s information battlefield demands speed, scale, and persistence. Speed, because narratives form quickly and harden fast. Scale, because digital transport layers allow messages to reach millions instantly. Persistence, because influence is cumulative. It rewards actors willing to repeat, reinforce, and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military leaders are increasingly recognizing that communications is not a peripheral function, it is a commander’s business. Every action or inaction is an information operation. Tone, repetition, and secondary amplification matter as much as initial statements. And dominating that narrative requires dominating the transport layers that carry it. That includes terrestrial networks, undersea cables, satellite infrastructure, and increasingly, space-based assets. Space is not peripheral to information warfare; it is foundational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another critical component to consider is that of attribution. In the cyber domain, attackers benefit from ambiguity. If malicious actors can hide behind plausible deniability or if governments can shield them, deterrence collapses. Credible attribution raises costs. It narrows safe havens. It signals resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some countries are beginning to codify this posture. Latvia, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idea.int/democracytracker/report/latvia/may-2024#:~:text=Parliament%20criminalises%20use%20of%20deep,public%20official%20by%20the%20Parliament.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has criminalized election-related fake news&lt;/a&gt; and deepfakes, recognizing that information manipulation is not abstract speech but a direct threat to democratic integrity. The United States faces a harder question: are our legal and institutional structures optimized for cognitive deterrence? Or are they still calibrated for a previous era of warfare?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rise of Agentic Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the cognitive domain is decisive, technology will be central.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next frontier is not simply artificial intelligence, but agentic architecture - systems capable of augmenting commander decision-making in real time. The goal is not automation for its own sake. It is better recommendations. Faster synthesis. Clearer visibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture matters and open, modular systems are essential. Black boxes are strategically dangerous. Defense institutions need plug-and-play capabilities that allow integration of new tools as threats evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliability, not feature proliferation, should guide procurement – think more Amazon.com rather than bespoke. Outcome-based acquisition must replace programmatic inertia. A culture of velocity must supplant a culture of compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan, smaller, foreign terrorist organizations were easier to degrade than deeply embedded, locally rooted movements like the Taliban. Structure mattered. Networks with widespread local integration were far more resilient. The same principle applies to narrative ecosystems. Loosely connected but culturally embedded influence networks are harder to disrupt than centralized propaganda hubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If adversaries build durable cognitive infrastructure across diaspora communities, digital platforms, and local influencers, countering them requires more than takedowns. It requires building alternative narratives and actions with comparable persistence and legitimacy. Cognitive advantage requires a network of networks approach (think private-public), operating at the intersections of shared security interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Terrain Is Strategic Terrain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most underappreciated shift in today’s information environment is cultural. Gaming now plays a role similar to Hollywood’s influence after World War II. Streaming platforms dominate storytelling. Media consumption patterns are fragmented and algorithmically curated. Stories remain, as one speaker observed, “the fuel of the human soul.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, institutions like Voice of America succeeded because audiences sought out American content. The positive narrative of opportunity and possibility carried weight. In today’s environment, focusing solely on countering adversaries may be insufficient. Affirmative narratives about democratic resilience, economic opportunity, and alliance strength remain strategic assets. If the center of gravity is ideological, then cultural confidence is not soft power. It is core power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this is executable without human capital. Building a cognitive arsenal requires building a cognitive workforce - professionals who are fluent in AI, media ecosystems, psychology, geospatial intelligence, and policy. Upskilling is not optional. Institutions must cultivate interdisciplinary talent capable of integrating technology and narrative strategy. They must also accelerate collaboration across government, private sector, and research institutions. And Government is looking to the private sector for training, skill development, and use of advanced technology, methods and applications. The adversary does not operate in stovepipes. Neither can we.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important question raised at that conference in Reston may have been the simplest: Are we structured to enact our own strategy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States possesses extraordinary technological and intellectual advantages. But advantages unrealized are advantages lost. If cognitive warfare is indeed the new frontier of power, then institutional adaptation- not incremental reform - will determine success. Speed, modularity, reliable attribution, cultural fluency, and decision-centric AI must move from theory to practice. Because in this domain, the battlefield is not a distant theater. It is perception itself. And perception, once shifted, is far harder to reclaim than territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://information-professionals.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinnacle_2026_Agenda_10Feb2026.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinnacle Conference&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was hosted by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://information-professionals.org/event/pinnacle-2025/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information Professionals Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nationalcenterfornarrativeintelligence.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National Center for Narrative Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and The Cipher Brief at the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carahsoft.com/carahsoft-conference-collaboration-center&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carahsoft Conference &amp; Collaboration Center&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; on YouTube?

      <title>Killing Mencho</title>

The&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gob.mx/defensa/prensa/la-secretaria-de-la-defensa-nacional-informa-sobre-una-operacion-para-la-detencion-de-ruben-n-a-mencho&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Mexican government&lt;/a&gt; has revealed only that its air force and special forces commandos descended on a safe house in the quaint Sierra Madre town of Tapalpa early yesterday, encountered gunfire and returned it, killing four cartel gunmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Mencho, whose real name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/nemesio-ruben-oseguera-cervantes-el-mencho-2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes&lt;/a&gt;, is the 59-year-old founder and leader of the Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG). Cervantes was wounded in the exchange of gunfire, loaded onto a Mexican military aircraft and flown to Mexico City. According to officials, he didn’t survive the flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials announced that they seized “various weapons and armored vehicles… including rocket launchers capable of shooting down aircraft and destroying armored vehicles” as a result of the raid. Such heavy military-grade weapons don’t just materialize without somebody knowing about them. A lot of people, in fact. Who sold them to Mencho’s paramilitary organization? Where did they originate? Are there others? Officials won’t have the opportunity to interrogate Cervantes about the influential people who were on his payroll as he grew his ultra-violent cartel into a global powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to DEA intelligence, his cartel is worth billions and has a presence in all 50 American states and 40 countries. Some American agents believe the Mexican government never wanted to take him alive. In fact, for most of his career, as he was consolidating his power, Mexican leaders have told the U.S. that their forces were unable to find and arrest him. What changed? Experts believe at least two things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, Mexican leaders finally got fed up with El Mencho’s blood-soaked reign. “The CJNG was public enemy number one” for President Claudia Sheinbaum’s administration, Michael Chavarria, formerly the Drug Enforcement Administration’s senior leader in Guadalajara, the Mexican cartels’ original base of operations, told &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s the one cartel out of favor with President Claudia Sheinbaum, especially as it was responsible for the attempt on the life of Security Secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch, just prior to Sheinbaum’s election.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garcia Harfuch, an aggressive, outspoken crime-fighter considered to be Mexico’s second most powerful official, survived a cartel assassination attempt in 2020, when he was Mexico City’s police chief. He became the CJNG’s implacable nemesis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, under pressure from President Donald Trump and the U.S. Congress, Sheinbaum and other top officials started collaborating openly with the U.S. military and intelligence community, an unthinkable event just a few years ago. But that changed with the election of Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/insight/us-navy-seals-head-to-mexico-amid-tensions/gm-066358B091?gemSnapshotKey=066358B091-snapshot-0&amp;amp;ocid=bingnewssearch&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;U.S. Navy’s Seal Team 2&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Mexico around Feb. 16, ostensibly for a training exercise with Mexican military counterparts aimed at interdicting Chinese shipments of chemical precursors used to make the deadly opioid fentanyl, which has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. The timing is noteworthy. According to U.S. officials, Navy SEALs trained elite Mexican navy special forces units that captured, among others, infamous drug kingpins&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/12/us/what-it-was-like-to-capture-el-chapo-donovan&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 and&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/drug-lord-rafael-caro-quintero-captured-mexico-dea-7ff3005d4c848697458d73c669a72e6f&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Rafael Caro Quintero&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those operations and many others, DEA agents posted to Mexico and along the border provided intelligence gleaned from scores of paid informants recruited over decades. Many operations failed, apparently because they were compromised, but enough succeeded to convince President Trump, who declared drug trafficking and illegal migration top national security threats, to order the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies to step up their intelligence collections aimed at the Mexican underworld. The CIA reportedly added more drone surveillance flights over the border region as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sharing intelligence with the Mexican government has always been a fraught enterprise. Some plans were slow walked. For others, operational security was compromised by corruption at every level of the Mexican government. Sheinbaum’s predecessor, leftist Andrés Manuel López Obrador, openly disdained U.S. anti-drug efforts and famously said he would treat the crime cartels with &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/mexico-drug-cartels-migrants-hugs-not-bullets-violence-5cf8bbefe68ea9762a0bdd23868029f3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“hugs, not bullets.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The CJNG established a nation-wide network of corrupt alliances among federal, state, and local police and regional military – sufficient to afford them a degree of protection,” Chavarria told us. The DEA had recruited plenty of human sources inside Mexico over the decades, but agents complained. The problem was getting the Mexican government to use that intelligence to take action against key cartel lieutenants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have deep experience in national security and something to say? Drop us a note at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@thecipherbrief.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;info@thecipherbrief.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, as the CJNG’s power inside Mexico and around the world expanded precipitously, the Biden administration raised the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/nemesio-ruben-oseguera-cervantes-el-mencho-2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reward&lt;/a&gt; for El Mencho from $10 million to $15 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as he took office for the second time, Trump designated the CJNG and other Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Trump himself repeatedly pressed Sheinbaum to allow the U.S. military to mount anti-cartel operations deep in Mexican territory. She always refused. Trump and her team were warned that such incursions would inflame Mexican politicians and likely backfire, damaging Sheinbaum’s ability to work with the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compromise seems to have been that all boots visible on the ground and all triggers pulled would be strictly Mexican, while, behind the scenes, U.S. law enforcement, military and intelligence community personnel would provide “intelligence support,” as White House spokesperson &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/PressSec/status/2025751007594971346?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Karoline Leavitt&lt;/a&gt; posted yesterday on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though El Mencho has been declared dead, U.S. security experts say the war on the cartels is not even close to being over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He died like a dog,” Rep. &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RepDanCrenshaw/status/2025656536488370579?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dan Crenshaw, R-Tex.,&lt;/a&gt; a Navy SEAL veteran who has led Congressional anti-cartel initiatives, posted on X yesterday. “Cause for celebration – absolutely - but not a victory lap. Now, more than ever, it is critical to keep the pressure on the Mexican cartels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEA veterans say that El Mencho will be quickly replaced by one of his key lieutenants, probably his stepson, Juan Carlos Valencia Gonzalez, 41, known as El R-3, El JP, Tricky Tres or simply 03. He inherits narco DNA, not just from Mencho, a farm boy-turned-enforcer but, even more importantly from the Valencia clan, who are narco royalty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“El Mencho married into the Valencia family, taking Rosalinda Gonzalez Valencia as his wife,” says Chavarria, an expert on the Valencias and author of the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3OWwrBs&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Junior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, about a DEA penetration of the cartels. “This is a common practice among drug trafficking families – designed to solidify loyalty and to protect against betrayal. Narco intermarriages were and are regularly encountered in Mexico’s underworld.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The operation against Mencho is more about cracking the idea that powerful cartel leaders operate with impunity than bringing about the downfall of a cartel,” says Carlos Olivo, formerly DEA’s agent in charge in Guadalajara and assistant agent in charge in the key border city of El Paso. “Mencho had near absolute control in that area of Jalisco and for that to be penetrated and successful shows us that a willing partner can indeed turn the tide in Mexico,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olivo, an ex-Marine who led a DEA team hunting Mencho until recently and is now writing a book about the CJNG, warns that taking down the kingpin and his successors is “just one pillar. Corrupt politicians and banking and business sectors must be next.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the stakes in the billions and powerful, respected families involved in the country’s politics, banking and business sectors, can cleaning up Mexico’s institutions will take more than firepower and good intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For us Americans, reality won’t change,” says Chavarria. “Same drugs coming across, because of our demand. Same violence in Mexico. Wash, rinse, repeat. It is a small skirmish victory in a prolonged drug war. There will be more Menchos. On a positive note, however, no kingpin can last forever. They can run but they cannot escape their eventuality. Kingpins fall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; on YouTube?

      <title>Tracing the Evolution of Russian Hybrid Warfare</title>

It was the culmination of over a decade of experimentation in hybrid warfare, and of increasingly rigid assumptions inside Russia’s intelligence services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Crimea and the Donbas in 2014, through Syria and a series of covert and deniable operations across Europe and the Middle East, Moscow refined a model of conflict built on scripted roles for its security services and their proxies. Yet the same intelligence culture that enabled early gains with hybrid war in Georgia, Ukraine and elsewhere, also fostered deeply flawed prognostications about the utility of force and Russia’s ability to project power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second in a two-part series on Russian gray zone, or hybrid warfare. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-kremlin-files-russias-way-to-the-gray-zone&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;In the first article,&lt;/a&gt; Wiswesser analyzes the evolution of hybrid warfare and its practice in the decades leading up to Russia’s intervention in Ukraine in 2014.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia’s errors ultimately propelled it into a catastrophic all-out war in Ukraine in 2022. This article, which continues a study of Russia’s path to and through the Gray Zone, argues that tracing the evolution of Russian hybrid warfare through the lens of its intelligence services and their miscalculation is not merely an exercise in post-mortem analysis but a critical step toward more effectively deterring future Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the intervention in Ukraine in 2014, Russia’s so-called “non-contact” or gray warfare doctrine had its first major operational test for Russia, marking it’s most significant use of hybrid warfare. From their perspective, the Russian intelligence services (RIS) and its military succeeded in stunting the actions of Europe and the U.S. when Russia took large portions of the Donbas and Crimea utilizing “little green men.&quot; These were Russian GRU (military intelligence elite units), other Russian military units, and intelligence proxies acting in the interests of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Russian strategists, non-contact war was effective, and these conflicts laid the groundwork for the planning of Putin’s siloviki and “organs” of power—the FSB, GRU, and Russian Armed Forces - for a much larger invasion of Ukraine just 8 years later. Studying the run-up to Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and its hybrid war plan, can help better prepare NATO for the subsequent potential Russian aggression against the Baltics or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014-2015: Donbas, Crimea, and Syria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second decade of this century, as Russia’s debates over non-contact warfare continued within its military and intelligence agencies, planning started to counter what Russia viewed as undue influence from the West in the Caucasus, Central Asia, and most notably, Ukraine. It was the latter that Russia and Putin always considered unfinished business. Russian planners—initially a small group of Kremlin Siloviki and their staff from various ministries—were aware that their military was not prepared for a full-scale war with NATO and the West. Nevertheless, Moscow believed they controlled the narrative and that gaps in reforms of their military and air force could be offset by the RIS conducting sabotage, subversion, cyber warfare, and recruiting key defectors within the Ukrainian government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine interventions and insurgencies of 2014 carried out by Russia in the Donbas and Crimea were classic non-contact operations using reflexive control and malicious influence through the media. Russia’s narrative was circulated among sympathetic European politicians and elsewhere. The story of little green men and whether they “were or weren’t Russian troops” was propagated through active measures. This and other false stories about supposed Ukrainian fascism and atrocities gained significant traction, especially within Central Asian countries and among Russia’s allies. The narrative effectively prevented any unified response by the West and Europe until the occupation of Crimea and large parts of the Donbas became a fait accompli. For Russia, it was a major success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

In Syria, they practiced precision strikes, a key part of non-contact warfare, and demonstrated greater precision (than in Georgia) in the use of air power during strikes. Additionally, in Syria, RIS units like GRU Spetsnaz conducted operations embedded with various factions and partners on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This deployment gained momentum on the heels of the 2014 Ukrainian operations. It was a classic blend of gray zone operations between intelligence and military units. Syria was also seen as a chance for Russia to bleed green units in preparation for larger wars to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Africa during this same period, Putin’s former cook, then an oligarch, Yevgenniy Prigozhin, used the Wagner Group, a private army, to prop up regimes friendly to Russia. Wagner was one of dozens of private military companies, also known as&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hybridcoe.fi/publications/handbook-on-the-role-of-non-state-actors-in-russian-hybrid-threats/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;non-state actors, that Russia was using and continues to use to achieve strategic aims&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They acted as mercenaries to repress citizens and dissent, intervening as henchmen for hire across Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there was one overarching strategic goal that Putin and all his services focused on—Ukraine. For Russia and its intelligence services in particular, Ukraine remained unfinished business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine War Plans: Prepping the Battlefield&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Russia prepared in the years leading up to the full-scale invasion in 2022, it relied on its version of hybrid warfare, its doctrine of non-contact warfare, and all that it involved: active measures, cyber operations, and efforts to influence the media through reflexive control. In planning, they aimed to combine these measures with a limited air campaign and a significant ground invasion that appeared sufficient on paper but lacked professional soldiers, trained units, and the crucial 3-to-1 (or more) force ratio needed to succeed against Ukraine’s professional military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia’s thinking was enabled by and reinforced from decades of theory on non-contact war, their successes in both Georgia and Ukraine in 2014, and their belief they could pull off an occupation of and complete overthrow of the democratic government of Ukraine. Faulty prognostications by the RIS made Putin sure it would all work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to the Ukraine invasion in 2022, all three of Russia's main intelligence agencies—the FSB, SVR, and GRU—played prominent roles in Putin's planning and execution of the invasion. These agencies always viewed Ukraine and other former Soviet republics, which they call the “near abroad,” as extensions of Russia. The RIS never accepted its independence and couldn't see Ukraine, in particular, as a separate nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FSB, despite primarily being an internal agency, played an outsized role in planning the &quot;special military operation&quot;—the term they later used to describe the full invasion of Ukraine. The FSB Fifth Service was responsible for “operational information” and was prominent in both 2014 and the invasion eight years later. As the main source of intelligence analysis for President Putin, the FSB Fifth Service provided him with a steady flow of inaccurate reports, which he readily accepted. Many of those same FSB officers were infamously reported in the Russian blogosphere as having “picked out their apartments&quot; in Kyiv before the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FSB believed Russia could win in Ukraine. To weaken the battlefield, the FSB used influence operations across Russian-language and international media, working alongside their SVR/GRU colleagues. They were confident it could be effective because, to some extent, they succeeded in 2014 in muddying the waters about the nature of that conflict and how the international community should respond (or unfortunately, not). The West and NATO appeared hesitant to act and were unprepared. For the RIS, they thought it was a &quot;win&quot; they could replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FSB planned a continuation of these tactics in 2022, aiming to confuse the international focus long enough to ensure a quick victory and regime change in Ukraine. U.S. intelligence sharing and increased NATO awareness thwarted this, at least in part. The Foreign Service (the SVR) supplemented these active measures with its own networks of cooperative journalists, corrupt parties or politicians abroad, and what the SVR calls &quot;useful idiots,&quot; whom it could employ as witting or unwitting accomplices to help spread the Russian narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts in the West bought into this narrative, commenting across many media outlets on Russia’s “overwhelming force ratios” along the main axes of advance. Western generals and experts echoed Moscow’s position, repeatedly stating that “unfortunately, Ukraine can’t win.” Early in the war, Russian messaging worked in its favor once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia’s Military/Intelligence Failures in Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After practicing Russian military maneuvers in “Zapad” (West in Russian) exercises for several years, in early 2022, Zapad 2022 became the cover for the gathering of forces for the full-scale invasion. But this time, the West—Europe and the U.S.-- were better prepared. U.S. intelligence was shared directly with NATO and Ukraine. Ukraine was readied, and Russia was put on notice that it would not succeed in another gray war followed by an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, and unlike many negative predictions even in the West, the Ukrainians would fight, and Russia would bleed. When the Russians were forced to fight, they fought terribly, incompetently, and it has cost them over a million casualties as the war neared its fourth year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are important lessons to learn from Russia’s numerous failures in its operations in Ukraine. This article mainly focuses on intelligence services and hybrid warfare. For the Russian army, however, the widespread use of conscripts and their poor integration into battalion tactical groups with “kontraktniki” (contract soldiers) meant the BTGs were largely effective only on paper. Huge convoys showcasing significant “force ratios” were intended to intimidate Ukraine. Still, their equipment was not ready for combat deployment (for example, the many stories of underinflated tires and trucks running out of gas). The Russian Aerospace Forces lacked sufficient combat-trained pilots with the necessary experience in air campaigns to sustain a prolonged engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the intelligence services, Ukraine would starkly reveal their shortcomings. Russian Military Intelligence, the GRU planned for substantial roles in what they thought would be a quick victory in 2022. GRU Spetsnaz, or special operations units, were used in the 2022 invasion to a fault, thrown into frontal assaults for which these (claimed) elite elements were not designed. They became cannon fodder literally when the Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) could not carry out their planned roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with other infamous units, the GRU’s Unit 29155 distinguished itself with assassinations and attempted ones, not only in Ukraine but across Europe. They were also behind the 2018 attack on defector Sergey Skripal. But most of their early operations, including attempts allegedly to carry out a fast coup to overthrow President Zelensky, failed. RIS hit squads and teams from the GRU and FSB were sent in to stage what they planned as a coup, following an airborne assault--which also failed--at Hostomel airport outside Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other such operations in the Donbas were thwarted by Ukrainian intelligence. There were special operations units from the FSB deployed throughout Ukraine, including their teams &quot;Alpha&quot; and &quot;Vympel.&quot; These FSB units and others were particularly active in the occupied East. Their crimes, including assassinations of local Ukrainian leaders, atrocities against civilians, and torture, are well documented and continue to the present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FSB, SVR, and GRU all promised Putin and his planners that they could conduct successful cyber operations to stun and disrupt the Ukrainian response in early 2022. These attacks were blunted primarily by the Ukrainians' own cyber defense capabilities and by early intelligence warnings from the West about the invasion. One example of attempted but failed Russian gray-zone ops is the FSB's Center 16, which is broadly responsible for signals intelligence and intercept operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Center 16 hires&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/russia-crime-uber-krysha&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;criminal hackers for the state&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an example again of non-state actors (NSAs). The FSB and other RIS units believed they could bring Ukraine to its knees with heavy cyber attacks on the government, and that these NSAs could play a significant role, including Russian organized crime groups. The planned cyber and criminal-assisted coup against Ukraine, like the broader invasion, failed. The RIS's predictions of success were again overly optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions: New Gray Zone War Without End&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2022, the Ukrainians have fought heroically and successfully defended their nation. Western support has played a key role, and that support should continue. But studying why Russia thought it could win and their doctrine and experience on the same, is key for our country and our allies preparing for the next war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the basis for the 2022 invasion, which includes Russia’s doctrine and history, is crucial. Russian war plans relied on the same concepts developed by figures like Sliphchenko, Gareev, and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/05/gerasimov-doctrine-russia-foreign-policy-215538/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Chief of Staff Valeriy Gerasimov regarding non-contact warfare&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (as detailed in the first article of this series): a permanent front engaged in information warfare, sabotage, and other actions just below the threshold of actual war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the West, we should study our Russian adversaries in their own language, their military writings, culture, and traditions, so we can better counter them. Herein lie the lessons of Russian non-contact warfare, their understanding of hybrid tactics, and why they believed they could win—and still do. These lessons are critically important to prevent the next aggression by Russia. A recent&lt;a href=&quot;https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/war-without-end-russias-shadow-warfare/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;study by the Center for European Analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; highlights that Russia’s strategy involves constant escalation against Europe and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Russian victory—or even a frozen conflict on Moscow’s terms—would validate a decade-long experiment in revisionism by stealth and force. It would signal to allies and adversaries alike that escalation works, that borders are negotiable, and that democratic societies lack the endurance to defend the order they claim to lead. Helping Ukraine prevail is therefore not an act of charity or sentiment; it is a strategic necessity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the United States and its allies, the lesson is clear. Supporting Ukraine through to a just and durable outcome is inseparable from preparing for the next evolution of the Russian gray zone. That means investing in deterrence across domains, hardening democratic institutions against subversion, confronting malign influence early rather than episodically, and abandoning the illusion that stability can be purchased through restraint. A nation founded on the belief that freedom is an inalienable right cannot afford strategic ambiguity about whether it will defend those who fight for the same principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gray zone is already contested terrain. The question is not whether conflict will continue, but whether the West is prepared to meet it with clarity, resolve, and the will to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the US Government.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four years of grueling war have devastated Ukraine’s infrastructure, displaced millions of people, and pushed its economy to the brink. But sound policy, a surge in defense spending, sustained international aid, and restored air and sea access have stabilized demand and brought GDP close to prewar levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evelyn Farkas on Alliances, Ukraine, and China’s Growing Challenge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERT INTERVIEW —&lt;/strong&gt; Evelyn Farkas has spent decades working at the center of U.S. national security and transatlantic defense policy. A former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, she now serves as Executive Director of the McCain Institute, where she focuses on strengthening democratic alliances and confronting authoritarian threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farkas spoke with The Cipher Brief’s Suzanne Kelly from the Munich Security Conference, where global leaders gathered amid continued war in Ukraine, uncertainty about U.S. commitments abroad, and growing concern over China’s long-term ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are highlights from the conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;expert-block-container expert-list&quot;&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;expert-original-about&quot;&gt;
          Dr. Evelyn N. Farkas is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, and served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia/Ukraine/Eurasia from 2012 to November 2015 and as Executive Director of the Graham-Talent WMD Commission. 
    	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE INTERVIEW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly: With everything going on right now from the Middle East to Ukraine to technology and AI and how that’s going to impact global security overall, what is top of mind for you there in Munich?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farkas:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it’s the state of the transatlantic alliance and then beyond that really all U.S. alliances. For me, that’s the thing that matters most. And I think that’s what Europeans and others, even those outside of Europe, especially our Asian allies, are going to be listening for. Are we still united?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly: Secretary Marco Rubio is expected to deliver a message here. What are you hoping to hear from him?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farkas:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m hoping he gives a speech more like the one Secretary Gates gave when he was exhorting Europeans to do more to carry the burden of our collective defense. Obviously now it’s urgent. Russia is conducting kinetic attacks on European territory every week. Europeans need to step up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beyond that, I hope he reasserts the U.S. commitment to the alliance because it’s in the U.S. interest. It undergirds our way of life, our democracy, our security, and our economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly: Are you seeing any shift in how Europeans are thinking about the alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farkas:&lt;/strong&gt; I think there’s a bifurcation. The working-level cooperation is still happening. We’re all working together, whether in government or out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, Europeans are much more distrustful of America. They’re not sure whether they can rely on us, and they don’t understand why our president has taken an approach that has at times been quite hostile rhetorically toward the allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly: How are you thinking about the Russia-Ukraine war from Munich?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farkas:&lt;/strong&gt; Everything depends on us getting this right, meaning the world community. The Ukrainians are fighting and will continue to fight. They have won this war strategically—it’s just a question of when and at what cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia cannot conquer and rule Ukraine. They’re weak economically and politically. Their military machine is being squeezed and needs to be squeezed more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need increased sanctions on Russia, but we also need to sanction China more because China is allowing Russia to continue the war, not just by buying oil but by providing technological dual-use capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly: How is Europe thinking about China?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farkas:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m a little bit concerned. The Japanese have taken a very strong approach. They’re maintaining deterrence and not pretending they share values with China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in Europe, we’re seeing leaders travel to Beijing and hedge. Europeans need to be careful because China is not their friend. China will eat their lunch in a minute, and China is not a democracy. You don’t want to be aligned with that kind of government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly: Looking ahead, what are the most critical issues to get right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farkas:&lt;/strong&gt; The most important thing is helping Ukraine bring the message home to the Russian elite and the Russian people that they cannot win militarily and that Ukraine will maintain its sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deterring China is equally important. China is pushing the envelope, and we need to maintain our strength against both adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelly: Final thoughts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farkas:&lt;/strong&gt; We must help Ukraine win and maintain sovereignty, and we must deter China. Those are the defining strategic challenges right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert insights into national security in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecipherbrief.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, still wanted by American authorities on a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/dispatches/next-steps-to-secure-venezuelas-democratic-future/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;$25&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; million bounty for narco-terrorism charges, controls Venezuela’s coercive forces and armed collectives. His role in coordinating political prisoner releases illustrates the paradox of the current transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foro Penal, Venezuela’s leading human rights organization that has provided pro bono legal assistance to victims of arbitrary detention since 2002, estimates that approximately&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_political_prisoner_release_in_Venezuela&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;711&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; political prisoners are detained as of mid-February. Releases often come with severe restrictions. When opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa was&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/08/americas/venezuela-political-prisoners-opposition-released-latam-intl&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;freed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on February 8 after eight&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/08/americas/venezuela-political-prisoners-opposition-released-latam-intl&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;months&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of detention, armed men abducted him hours later. He is now under house arrest with an ankle monitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were released, they reunited with their families, until the enlightened stupidity of some politicians led them to believe they could do whatever they wanted and stir up trouble in the country,” Cabello&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2026/02/10/venezuelan-thug-chief-diosdado-cabello-defends-abduction-freed-political-prisoner/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;stated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after Guanipa’s re-arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luis Bustos, the Bogotá-based spokesperson for the Venezuelan opposition party Primero Justicia, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that his party alone has 61 members imprisoned as political prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is still a high risk of getting arrested if authorities are aware that you are happy about the situation,” Bustos continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Caracas and popular zones, armed collectives demonstrate the regime’s ability to maintain social control outside of formal state structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After Maduro’s arrest, a circular went out saying that opposition supporters would be captured and obviously alluding to actions of justice by these groups,” Vaquero insists. “So repression itself has not diminished, not in a constant way, not in a sustainable way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elections: A Constitutional Impossibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan opposition figures and Washington officials increasingly acknowledge that legitimate elections cannot take place in the near term. The electoral system’s corruption under Chavismo extends beyond fraudulent vote counting to fundamental issues of voter registry manipulation and military involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This government put deceased people to vote,” Vaquero claims. “This government gave identity cards indiscriminately to Cubans, to Russians, to Chinese, to people from FARC, to people from ELN.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;María Corina Machado, the Nobel Peace Prize&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/08/americas/venezuela-political-prisoners-opposition-released-latam-intl&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;laureate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; leading Venezuela’s unified opposition, estimated in early February that transparent elections using manual voting could take place within 9 to 10&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wlrn.org/2026-02-13/nbc-news-venezuelan-president-delcy-rodriguez-pledges-free-and-fair-elections-but-no-future-date&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;months&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez, Delcy’s brother and key regime interlocutor with Washington,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2026/02/10/latam-venezuela-elelctions-later/1371770749886/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;ruled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; out elections in the near future, citing the need for stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

When pressed on when elections might be held, Leavitt stated: “It’s too premature and too early to dictate a timetable for elections in Venezuela right now.” She emphasized that the administration has “maximum leverage over the interim authorities in Venezuela,” and that “their decisions are going to continue to be dictated by the United States of America.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The constitutional framework technically allows Acting President Rodríguez to serve 90 days, with a possible ninety-day extension if approved by the Chavista-controlled National&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/dispatches/next-steps-to-secure-venezuelas-democratic-future/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Assembly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Temporary absence provisions, however, are interpreted creatively by the Supreme Court, which effectively eliminates any firm deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. intelligence official focused on Latin America issues, speaking on background to &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, estimates that credible elections extend well beyond constitutional requirements. The source highlights that comprehensive electoral reform requires dismantling power structures that are still firmly entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bustos also underscores that elections might realistically occur as early as next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need first of all to get a country more stable,” he says. “We need to put our institutions on stronger foundations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without functioning democratic institutions, independent electoral authorities, or international oversight mechanisms in place, any rushed election would ratify the status quo. Under current conditions, elections would not be free or fair because the regime controls voters’ registries and ballots. As long as the same power structure is still in place, cosmetic reforms cannot address this fundamental barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage and Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these obstacles, the Trump administration can drive genuine change by maintaining pressure through its military presence and negotiations over sanctions relief. It appears, however, that the regime is trying to outlast Washington’s attention by complying tactically with American demands while maintaining fundamental power structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paola Salazar, director for Medellín and Antioquia state at Colombia’s government migration agency, Migración Colombia, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that pendular migratory flows between Colombia and Venezuela have&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/5/delcy-rodriguez-sworn-in-as-venezuelas-president-after-maduro-abduction&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;remained&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stable since January 3, suggesting Venezuelans are not yet convinced conditions have fundamentally changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Alejandro Méndez Hernández, a Venezuelan community organizer in Bogotá, tells &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that trust is still absent, hence migrants are not returning despite Maduro’s removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a huge amount of Venezuelans being arrested as political prisoners, who haven’t been released until today, so it’s not building trust,” he continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acting President Rodríguez&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wlrn.org/2026-02-13/nbc-news-venezuelan-president-delcy-rodriguez-pledges-free-and-fair-elections-but-no-future-date&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; NBC News earlier this month that she would hold free and fair elections but declined to commit to a timeline, stating that the schedule would be determined through political dialogue. When pressed about Machado, Rodríguez said she would face legal scrutiny upon any return for calling for military intervention and sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio has publicly outlined a three-phase approach for Venezuela’s future — stability, recovery, and transition to democracy — though he has declined to provide a specific timeline. During his January 28 Senate Foreign Relations Committee testimony, Rubio emphasized that “the end state here is we want a friendly, stable, prosperous Venezuela, and democratic, in which all elements of society are represented in free and fair elections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Rubio acknowledged the complexity of the timeline, stating, “We’re not going to get there in three weeks. It’s going to take some time.” In subsequent remarks to reporters, he added that the transition “can’t take forever” and acknowledged there must be progress within several months. However, he cautioned that “this is not a campaign to leave in place the systems currently in place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Diosdado Factor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interior Minister Cabello represents the most significant obstacle to a genuine transition. With control over security forces, intelligence services, and armed collectives, he possesses the coercive apparatus necessary to maintain regime control independent of formal governmental structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diosdado Cabello has a price imposed by the United States,” Vaquero explains. “He controls the coercive apparatus and all the internal loyalties. We’ve seen him lately. Every time he appears in Venezuelan media, he looks scared.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. intelligence source identifies Cabello as the key figure whose removal or neutralization would be necessary for an authentic democratic opening. As long as Cabello maintains control of security forces, any political transition will be cosmetic rather than substantive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His control extends beyond formal military and police to encompass armed civilian collectives that intimidate opposition supporters and maintain social control, operating with impunity while allowing the regime to claim official restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Influence and Regional Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regime’s historical relationships with Iran, Hezbollah, Russia, and China complicate transition planning. Despite keeping a low profile after Maduro’s removal, these actors continue to threaten American national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bustos stresses that the presence of Hezbollah and Iranian-linked entities necessitates an extended transition period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The United States certainly knows about it,” he says. “I think that it’s not possible to get them out of the country really quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The re-extradition of Colombian-Venezuelan businessman Alex Saab in early&lt;a href=&quot;https://colombiaone.com/2026/02/04/fbi-arrests-alex-saab-maduro-venezuela/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;February&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, designated by the United States as a key financial operator for Maduro, demonstrates some cooperation from regime elements with American law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saab’s arrest represents a significant test of cooperation with Washington. U.S. authorities accused Saab of moving approximately&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Saab&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;$350&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; million out of Venezuela through corrupt contracts, making him central to understanding how the regime financed itself under sanctions. His potential extradition signals Rodríguez is willing to sacrifice even Maduro’s closest financial operatives to maintain Washington’s support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 9&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2026/2/4/these-exiled-venezuelans-dream-of-returning-home-whats-stopping-them&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Venezuelans in the diaspora are reassessing their return prospects, yet few are making immediate plans to return. The combination of continued repression, economic uncertainty, and the presence of the same officials who forced their exile creates a wait-and-see dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan passports cost approximately&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2026/2/4/these-exiled-venezuelans-dream-of-returning-home-whats-stopping-them&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;$700&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the black market when available, complicating both legal status abroad and potential return. Embassies and consulates are largely non-functional, creating a documentation crisis that traps Venezuelans in limbo regardless of whether they wish to return home or establish permanent residence elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a fundamental question for Washington intelligence planners: Does the current arrangement represent a genuine transition, or is it simply the regime’s survival under American pressure? Continuing imprisonment of opposition figures and constitutional maneuvers to avoid elections suggest the former.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official from the U.S. intelligence community notes the regime is maintaining strategic control while ensuring tactical compliance. In the absence of sustained military and economic pressure and clear benchmarks, the current government will likely continue to drag its feet on reforms for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prisoner release pattern is illustrative. While&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_political_prisoner_release_in_Venezuela&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;hundreds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have been freed, the process is opaque, reversible, and controlled entirely by Cabello’s interior ministry. As well as gag orders, those released are subject to re-arrest for hypothetical “political activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino’s presentation of a golden baton to Rodríguez at a military&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wunc.org/2026-02-05/venezuelas-interim-leader-works-to-balance-u-s-demands-and-chavista-expectations&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;parade&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in February symbolized the armed forces’ continued allegiance to Chavista structures rather than any new democratic order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela’s situation tests the Trump administration’s approach to authoritarian transitions. Government policy toward Venezuela currently reflects a calculated preference for energy security over democratic reform. Washington views maintaining regional stability and securing oil access as more pressing strategic priorities than the unpredictable outcomes of rapid political reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s stated objectives for Venezuela emphasize democratic transition. Rubio&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/01/secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-before-the-senate-committee-on-foreign-relations-on-u-s-policy-towards-venezuela&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;told the Senate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Washington seeks “free and fair elections” where “all elements of society are represented,” noting pointedly that “you can have elections all day,” but without media access for opposition and the ability for opposition candidates to run freely, “those aren’t free and fair elections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the administration’s actions reveal a calculated preference for energy security over rapid political reform. In the same testimony, Rubio prioritized Venezuela becoming “a friendly, stable, prosperous” partner and ending threats from “Hezbollah and Iran in our own hemisphere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington views maintaining regional stability and securing oil access as more pressing strategic priorities than the unpredictable outcomes of immediate democratic reforms. This pragmatism risks legitimizing a rebranded authoritarianism, retaining the repressive mechanisms of Maduro’s regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, observers caution that this pragmatism may come at a cost in the long run. By prioritizing energy and migration management, the U.S. risks legitimizing a rebranded authoritarianism that retains the repressive mechanisms of Maduro’s regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela James Story&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wunc.org/2026-02-05/venezuelas-interim-leader-works-to-balance-u-s-demands-and-chavista-expectations&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;assessed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Rodríguez will play for time, doing “just enough to make it look as if they are complying” while waiting for U.S. focus to shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela’s post-Maduro transition ultimately reveals limitations of decapitation strategies against entrenched authoritarian systems. While removing Maduro eliminated the regime’s symbolic figurehead, the intelligence and security apparatus is intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elections cannot occur in the short term, at least not elections meeting minimal standards of freedom and fairness. There is corruption in the electoral infrastructure, arrests of opposition figures for political activities, and the ability and leadership of those who would suppress genuine democratic opening is intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the current arrangement provides tactical benefits, it also leaves strategic vulnerabilities regarding oil access and preventing a migration surge. The same figures wanted on U.S. criminal charges coordinate government functions. The same security services that tortured political prisoners manage their conditional release. The same armed collectives that intimidated voters patrol neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where Diosdado Cabello has been, obviously repression has not disappeared,” Vaquero adds. “It materializes with collectives, with social pressure, with selective judicialization. And obviously, while Diosdado remains in power, there won’t be profound change but rather tactical changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump and his acolytes have long promoted the narrative that the European Union is weak and misguided, and there was no let-up at the World Economic Forum’s annual gathering Davos in January or at this month’s Munich Security Conference. But the truth is that Europe’s social-market model and commitment to openness continue to pay dividends. Far from doubting itself, the EU should double down on its strengths and, as the US-China geopolitical rivalry heats up, tout them as an example for the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump’s Venezuela strategy prioritizes oil reconstruction over elections, treating democracy as an afterthought. But without credible institutions and political legitimacy, Venezuela cannot attract the private capital needed to rebuild its oil sector or provide the legal certainty long-term projects demand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Crypto is embedded in Russia’s procurement model, allowing it an access to Common High Priority Items that international sanctions were intended to deny.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While training civilian pilots as military reserve pilots for fast jets is not a realistic prospect for the UK and most other European nations, it is worth considering reservist pilots for secondary air defence duties in turboprop aircraft against one-way attack drones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the rules-based international order breaking down, “minilateralism”  might offer a means of devising new ideas – in particular, for scalable interventions that tangibly improve people’s lives.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By repealing the &quot;endangerment finding&quot; that required US authorities to consider the societal costs of greenhouse-gas emissions, the Trump administration has further reduced the regulatory burden on US banks relative to their peers.
