      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's ceasefire agreement in Gaza could be the first step toward peace, but only if it evolves into a full-fledged plan that recognizes and appreciates the decades-long Palestinian struggle and allows new Palestinian leaders to emerge. As matters stand, these basic conditions are not being met.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How China Achieved Innovation Without Freedom</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Though China remains a one-party state that disappears dissidents and censors ideas, it has vaulted past Japan, Germany, and France to become the world’s tenth most-innovative economy. It owes this achievement – which was long considered impossible – to a pioneering strategy of &quot;smart authoritarianism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amid a corruption scandal, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky may well be able to convince EU leaders to remain focused on the “real enemy”: Russia. But further revelations will weaken his position in negotiations with a US administration eager for a foreign-policy victory, leaving ordinary Ukrainians to pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Achieving Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious goal will require far more than accelerating economic growth. Without stronger institutions, improved education, and updated infrastructure, India’s current momentum will not be enough to sustain long-term development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recently signed strategic partnership between Canada and Sweden is a modest move with outsize geopolitical implications. Canada can begin to reduce its overreliance on the United States, Sweden can increase its influence and market share, and NATO will get a stronger northern flank that is less exposed to swings in US politics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
