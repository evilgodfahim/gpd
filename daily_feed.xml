      <description>&lt;p&gt;The modern media landscape has given far-right &quot;thinkers&quot; a salience beyond their wildest dreams, reflected in the new US National Security Strategy. But their pseudo-intellectualism will never pass as the real thing, and while they may court the working class, it is financiers and tech billionaires whose interests they serve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new US National Security Strategy bears the cognitive signature of a movement that experiences demographic and cultural change as existential catastrophe. The goal is not merely to ignore real threats but to redefine the threat itself as the presence of people President Donald Trump calls “garbage.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>All Cash-Strapped Governments Should Be Using this Tool</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By engaging in outcomes-based partnerships, governments can advance social-policy goals at half the cost, while paying only when targets have been achieved. Better yet, such initiatives can be scaled up massively, because they offer precisely the kind of opportunities that socially minded investors have been seeking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are five issues that any UK government must address in order to bring about a robust economic recovery, beginning with launching a process to rejoin the European single market or customs union. But rationalizing spending on the National Health Service, pensions, and welfare benefits will require considerably more courage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reaching climate neutrality by 2050 is non-negotiable, but it is impossible to know in 2025 the best way to get there. Rather than attempt to dictate the pathway now, EU policymakers must design a strategy that leaves space for unexpected innovations and adequately accounts for geopolitical risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The pardon power is the only authority the US Constitution places entirely in the president’s hands, immune from legislative override or judicial review. For Alexander Hamilton, who assumed that shame would restrain abuse, Donald Trump is the nightmare scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
