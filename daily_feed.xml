That means building the state capacity that will translate national sustainable-development plans into measurable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates recently argued that we should de-emphasize the existential threat posed by climate change in order to “put human welfare at the center of our climate strategies.” But how tolerant should we be of the risk of creating a climate that will be disastrous for human welfare for centuries to come?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Washington Consensus assumed that economic growth would automatically follow market liberalization.
