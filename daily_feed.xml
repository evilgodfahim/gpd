      <description>Although there was a massive boom in AI-related investments in 2025, policy-induced uncertainties and disruptions to official data releases clouded the picture.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading like it was dictated by the Kremlin, the Trump administration's latest &quot;peace&quot; plan for Ukraine would have dire implications not only for that country, but also for Europe and the rest of the world. The message is simple and unmistakable: Now that it stands for nothing, the United States can easily be bought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thousands of infrastructure projects across the United States are mired in red tape, driving up prices and eroding Americans’ quality of life. The solution is not more technology or consultants, but rather rebuilding government capacity by hiring and retaining skilled engineers to manage projects efficiently and control costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>US President Donald Trump’s Ukraine peace plan is a non-starter for anyone who believes in the rule of law and supports European security. As negotiators continue to revise the terms, Europe must make clear that it will support Ukraine in opposing any deal that rewards Russian aggression.</description>

      <description>Whatever changes Ukrainian negotiators manage to wrest out of US officials, there is no question that President Donald Trump’s peace plan represents a strategic defeat not only for Ukraine, but for all of Europe. Rather than blaming Trump, however, Europeans need to take responsibility for their role in creating this situation.</description>
