      <title>Trump Has Condemned Europe to Success</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To survive in a dangerous new world, the European Union, established as an antidote to power politics, must contradict the very principle on which it was founded by becoming a superpower in its own right. Fortunately, it already has all the assets it needs in order to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is right to warn that the old global order has ruptured, and that middle powers must now come together to advance shared interests. They can do so by embracing the principles guiding narrower multilateral arrangements that have proved more effective than many realize.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump is betting that aggressive fiscal stimulus, deregulation, and looser monetary policy can deliver rapid growth without rekindling inflation. But centuries of experience across dozens of countries suggest that the kind of heterodox experiment now underway in the US rarely ends well in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
