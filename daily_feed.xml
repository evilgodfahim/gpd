      <title>Trump’s Ethnonational Security Strategy</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/trump-s-ethnonational-security-strategy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The United States’ new National Security Strategy is a tissue of populist ideology that reflects no understanding of the real challenges facing the country and views the main threat as liberal democracy itself. The result will be bad for most Americans and their European allies, but highly beneficial for financiers, tech billionaires, racists, and authoritarian powers, especially Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Global Economy’s Hidden Rebalancing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the global growth rate in 2026 is projected to be almost the same as it was in 2025, the headline figure belies deeper structural shifts in capital flows and comparative advantage. These shifts are the real story, because they are quietly reshaping how global savings and investment interact over the coming decade.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Societies differ in their views on privacy, experimentation, market openness, and safety, so no single regulatory model can ever accommodate everyone’s preferences. But a shared architectural foundation based on certain core principles would give every country the flexibility to strike its own balance between risk and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A prospective rise in Japanese interest rates could indicate that not only Japan, but also other heavily indebted economies, including the United States, could face sharply higher yields on government bonds. The only way out for Japan is to boost economic growth; but for the US, it is to raise taxes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sufferers of cluster headaches, also known as &quot;suicide headaches,&quot; will do anything to stop what is possibly the most painful condition known to medicine, including using illegal drugs like psilocybin and LSD. Given strong evidence that psychedelics work, why aren't doctors allowed to prescribe them?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During World War II, an Allied tribunal convicted German submariners of murdering shipwrecked survivors. In doing so, it set two clear precedents that the Trump administration seems to have overlooked in defending a &quot;second strike&quot; that killed alleged drug smugglers clinging to their capsized boat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
