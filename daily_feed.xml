      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heading into this month's United Nations Climate Conference, evidence is mounting that the Global North will not meet its funding promises. But rich countries could still demonstrate good faith through another form of solidarity: sharing the knowledge, technology, and intellectual property that underpin the green transition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For AI to deliver its promised benefits, it must be designed in the humanist tradition, with people remaining unequivocally in control, and with human dignity always coming first.
