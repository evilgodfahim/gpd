      <title>Trump’s Travel Bans Threaten US National Security</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-new-entry-restrictions-will-undermine-national-security-by-brahma-chellaney-2026-01</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For all Donald Trump’s talk about security, he proves far more interested in lining his own pockets. No country that hosts a major Trump-branded property or strikes a high-profile business deal with a member of Trump’s inner circle – including some with well-documented ties to global terrorism – faces US travel restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Case for Universalism in a Fragmenting World</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/case-for-internationalism-at-a-time-of-nationalist-resurgence-by-kaushik-basu-2026-01</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The current wave of hyper-nationalism reflects growing anxiety over a deeply interconnected global economy that no longer fits neatly within political borders. While a world without nation-states remains a distant dream, we can at least strengthen existing supranational organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Energy Will Decide the AI Race</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the race to dominate AI has so far focused on cutting-edge chips and capital expenditures, all the data centers in the world will not help you if they lack a continuous supply of affordable energy. While China clearly understands this, America may not, and that could create an opportunity for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Truth About Europe’s Regulation of Digital Platforms</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump claims that Europeans are engaging in &quot;censorship&quot; when they require digital platforms to be transparent about their algorithms and to remove already illegal content. With the US recently barring entry to five Europeans it accuses of regulating online content, it is time to set the record straight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the United States and its allies finally led a push to end the Gaza war in 2025, it is not clear how regional stability will be restored, or what shape a new regional order will assume. For the foreseeable future, the Middle East will be bracing for a prolonged conflict as Israel pursues military supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
