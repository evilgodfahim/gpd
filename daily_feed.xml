      <title>Britain’s Fiscal Watchdog Doesn't See What Matters</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By ignoring the long-run effects of both government-funded and privately funded innovation, Britain's official budget scorer has been systematically underestimating the economy's potential output and the government's future fiscal headroom. The result is not fiscal discipline, but a costly illusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As governments weaken environmental protections to promote new mining projects, the global scramble for critical minerals is deepening social divides and harming vital ecosystems. Only reduced consumption and robust, enforceable rules can prevent long-term harm and protect basic human rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a world marked by volatility, no investment yields greater economic returns than supporting children in their first five or six years of life.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an increasingly multipolar world, India and the Gulf states are no longer merely trading partners but strategic actors in their own right.

      <title>Europe’s Tech Firms Need Regulation to Grow</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The European Commission's rushed plan to water down landmark dig’ital legislation reflects the view that excessive regulation is to blame for the lack of European firms capable of competing with the US tech giants. This logic is fundamentally flawed, and deregulation is destined to backfire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
