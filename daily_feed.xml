      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since World War II, liberal democracies have built and sustained their social contracts on three mutually reinforcing pillars: freedom, prosperity, and the rule of law. If Europe is to thrive in the 21st century and continue to serve as a model of democratic values, it must reinvigorate all three.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has inexplicably maintained high interest rates in a deflationary environment, which increases debt-service costs and suppresses economic activity. It must change course now, because austerity in the name of fiscal sustainability is self-defeating if it destroys the conditions for growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Illiberal World Order Is Here</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that Donald Trump's administration has explicitly rejected the international rules-based institutions and arrangements that America created after World War II, the very idea of an international order is no longer relevant. The world now belongs to illiberal regimes intent on pursuing their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The G20 Can No Longer Postpone Debt Relief</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea that Africa can finance the green transition while simultaneously spending huge sums on debt service is absurd. That is why the upcoming G20 summit in Johannesburg must end with a commitment to restructuring the liabilities of highly indebted countries, most of which are on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But, for now, the gains from AI look more muted, and the macro downsides larger, than in the case of the dot-com bubble.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
