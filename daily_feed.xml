      <description>&lt;p&gt;A century of credit-driven growth has left most economies dependent on banks that fund only the safest bets. By lowering the costs of disclosure, due diligence, and compliance, AI could open equity markets to the smaller, riskier firms that drive innovation and job creation, unlocking a new engine of sustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Surveys show that emerging economies’ populations are not only well aware of the opportunities AI creates, but also more optimistic about the technology than advanced-economy populations. They might not lead the way in building AI models, but they can use the technology to advance their economic- and social-development goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
