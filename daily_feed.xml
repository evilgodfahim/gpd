      <description>&lt;p&gt;By attending a big investment summit in Hong Kong, Western financiers are showing what really drives them.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Chinese leaders prepare the 15th Five-Year Plan, early signs indicate that it will focus on continuing China’s extraordinary technological ascendancy.
