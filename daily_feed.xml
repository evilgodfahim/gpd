      <title>The Case for European Nationalism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite US President Donald Trump’s claims to the contrary, Europe’s problem is not too much integration but too little.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the term “polycrisis” can be useful in describing the tangle of threats the world currently faces, it fails to capture our role in creating – or finding a way out of – our current situation. While profound disruption carries acute risks, it also provides a rare opening for far-reaching transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tech titans like Elon Musk are offering us a future of socialism from above, where they keep the means of production while everyone else gets an allowance.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is shifting from a largely hegemonic international system to a more fragmented, contested, and multipolar set of arrangements.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Effective climate adaptation can strengthen countries’ resilience, protect vulnerable communities, and support economic growth.
