      <description>&lt;p&gt;As AI moves from experimentation to real-world applications, the limits imposed by the physical world, capital markets, and political systems clearly matter more than its theoretical potential. Fortunately, such constraints are not hurdles to progress, but rather the scaffolding behind which it will take shape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Antitrust Delayed Is Antitrust Denied</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Meta’s recent antitrust win in a high-profile case brought by US regulators illustrates the challenges of reactive measures. Taking a preventive approach – namely, challenging mergers when they are first proposed – is a better way to prevent the emergence of monopolies in fast-moving tech markets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, citizens of the Soviet Union scoffed at Leonid Brezhnev’s demented vanity, his insatiable need for praise, and the obsequiousness of his entourage. But it was nothing compared to the self-aggrandizing behavior of Donald Trump and the sycophancy of his enablers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Irresistible Temptation of Chile’s Polarized Politics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, Chileans were tempted by the promise of a progressive “refoundation” of the country under Gabriel Boric, a former student leader, and elected him president. Now they have swung in the opposite direction, electing the far-right José Antonio Kast –&amp;nbsp;and are likely to be equally disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best that can be said of Trump’s approach to the economy is that it is an experimental phase in the post-neoliberal transition. The good news is that future policymakers will not have to look far for new guiding principles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
