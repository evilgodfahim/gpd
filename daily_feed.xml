      <title>The Coming Crypto Apocalypse</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The future of money and payments will feature gradual evolution, not the revolution that crypto-grifters promised. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies’ latest plunge further underscores the highly volatile nature of this pseudo-asset class; one only hopes that policymakers will wake up to the risks before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rather than address the weaknesses of the grant-based approach to global health financing, donors want to scrap it in favor of instruments that mobilize more private capital. But this new architecture distorts the risk landscape in ways that socialize losses, while privatizing profits and control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Should Western Tech Giants Partner With Pro-Hamas Network Al Jazeera?</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/should-western-tech-giants-partner-with-pro-hamas-network-al-jazeera</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;A few weeks ago, Al Jazeera &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2025-12-21-Al-Jazeera-Media-Network-Launches-The-Core,-an-AI-Integrated-News-Model-Built-on-Google-Cloud&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2025-12-21-Al-Jazeera-Media-Network-Launches-The-Core,-an-AI-Integrated-News-Model-Built-on-Google-Cloud&quot;&gt;named&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Google Cloud as its primary technology provider for “The Core,” a sweeping program designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence (AI) throughout its production process. The move, which further deepened the relationship between the two companies, should sound alarm bells for policymakers and anyone concerned with the accuracy, credibility, and transparency of the news media and information space, which impacts nearly every aspect of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Core enables more efficient reporting and even drafts scripts that humans generally would otherwise write. Reporters can pull archival material in seconds, generate compelling data visualizations — visual stories — and synthetic images at planetary scale, and automate story planning, all through AI platforms built by Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s not the innovation that’s the problem but rather its use to generate and amplify adversarial state-funded and directed news with no warning labels to its global audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Qatari state &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://empowr.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2020-09-14-DOJ-Jay-Bratt-to-DLA-Piper-Al-Jazeera-FARA-Registration.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://empowr.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2020-09-14-DOJ-Jay-Bratt-to-DLA-Piper-Al-Jazeera-FARA-Registration.pdf&quot;&gt;funds and oversees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Al Jazeera, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://empowr.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2020-09-14-DOJ-Jay-Bratt-to-DLA-Piper-Al-Jazeera-FARA-Registration.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://empowr.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2020-09-14-DOJ-Jay-Bratt-to-DLA-Piper-Al-Jazeera-FARA-Registration.pdf&quot;&gt;shaping editorial output&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Because of its shared ideology with the Muslim Brotherhood, Al Jazeera’s content often reflects the lens of the Muslim Brotherhood, three branches of which the United States just &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/01/terrorist-designations-of-muslim-brotherhood-chapters&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/01/terrorist-designations-of-muslim-brotherhood-chapters&quot;&gt;designated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; as a terrorist organization. The Qatari outlet also has a &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-787220&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-787220&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; of producing content that glorifies terrorism. Tech companies that help Al Jazeera amplify its content using algorithms, AI, or other methods, advance Qatari foreign policy rather than reflecting independent media assessments on a wide range of worldviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the Al Jazeera-Google program is “AJ-LLM,” described as the editorial brain of the system that will be trained on Al Jazeera’s archives and connected to Gemini Enterprise, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadcastprome.com/news/al-jazeera-launches-the-core-ai-news-model-on-google-cloud/#:~:text=At%20the%20centre%20of%20the,trends%20and%20develop%20predictive%20dashboards.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.broadcastprome.com/news/al-jazeera-launches-the-core-ai-news-model-on-google-cloud/#:~:text=At%20the%20centre%20of%20the,trends%20and%20develop%20predictive%20dashboards.&quot;&gt;according&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; to the companies. Al Jazeera is already very prominently cited in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude in questions about the Gaza war, and Gemini could very well follow that trajectory with this expanded partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While one reason Al Jazeera features prominently in LLM answers is because it has no paywall. New partnerships, including Google’s major expansion with Al Jazeera, may fuel its presence even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al Jazeera &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadcastprome.com/news/al-jazeera-launches-the-core-ai-news-model-on-google-cloud/#:~:text=At%20the%20centre%20of%20the,trends%20and%20develop%20predictive%20dashboards.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.broadcastprome.com/news/al-jazeera-launches-the-core-ai-news-model-on-google-cloud/#:~:text=At%20the%20centre%20of%20the,trends%20and%20develop%20predictive%20dashboards.&quot;&gt;assures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; there will be sufficient human oversight in the process. However, Al Jazeera’s current and historic content, with its anti-Western bias that amplifies the likes of Hamas, loaded into its LLM platform, will churn out faster, flashier versions of the same editorial product, in countless formats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;horizontal-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecipherbrief.com/subscriber-plus&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscriber+Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; get exclusive access to expert-driven briefings on the top national security issues we face today.

Because these AI systems operate as black boxes with limited transparency, audiences may receive &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://simonerodan.substack.com/p/how-al-jazeera-built-a-media-machine?utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://simonerodan.substack.com/p/how-al-jazeera-built-a-media-machine?utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true&quot;&gt;algorithmically amplified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; narratives that systematically favor Hamas and Muslim Brotherhood perspectives while appearing to be the product of neutral technological systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, Google &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gco.gov.qa/en/media-centre/top-news/gco-partners-with-google-news-initiative-and-al-jazeera-media-institute-to-deliver-media-training/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.gco.gov.qa/en/media-centre/top-news/gco-partners-with-google-news-initiative-and-al-jazeera-media-institute-to-deliver-media-training/&quot;&gt;partnered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; with the Qatari Government Communications Office and the Al Jazeera Media Institute to train journalists in building digital-focused newsrooms. Participants included news directors, journalists, and representatives from various media organizations across Qatar’s media landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of messages do Al Jazeera trainers convey to journalists and diplomats who take their courses? The case of Muhammed Khamaiseh from the Al Jazeera Media Institute is instructive. In 2018, Khamaiseh &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/F2MuB&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://archive.is/F2MuB&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, “Jews have been known for centuries to be cunning thinkers, and currently, the entire global economic system is under their control.” Khamaiseh had previously celebrated Hamas rocket attacks on Israeli civilians in 2014 and offered affection for Hamas after its kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers. “This is why we love Hamas :D,” he &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jns.org/journalism-of-jihad/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.jns.org/journalism-of-jihad/&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Ironically, Khamaiseh is the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://institute.aljazeera.net/sites/default/files/2019/Avoid-Discrimination-HateSpeech-Media.pdf?title=Avoiding%20Discrimination%20and%20Hate%20Speech%20in%20Media&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://institute.aljazeera.net/sites/default/files/2019/Avoid-Discrimination-HateSpeech-Media.pdf?title=Avoiding%20Discrimination%20and%20Hate%20Speech%20in%20Media&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; of “A Guide Avoiding Discrimination and Hate Speech in the Media, published by the Al Jazeera Media Institute.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qatar is an authoritarian nation, whose &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/01/qatar-repressive-new-law-further-curbs-freedom-of-expression/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/01/qatar-repressive-new-law-further-curbs-freedom-of-expression/&quot;&gt;stringent media laws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; prohibit any criticism of Qatari leadership or policy, making Al Jazeera’s output anything but independent. The Department of Justice has &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://empowr.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2020-09-14-DOJ-Jay-Bratt-to-DLA-Piper-Al-Jazeera-FARA-Registration.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://empowr.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2020-09-14-DOJ-Jay-Bratt-to-DLA-Piper-Al-Jazeera-FARA-Registration.pdf&quot;&gt;determined&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; that Al Jazeera is owned and directed by a foreign government. Congress has asked Justice to review whether the Qatari government should be required to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. DOJ has already required Al Jazeera’s AJ+ to register but the Qatari network has failed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq are among the countries that have placed bans on Al Jazeera. Some bans remain on the Qatari channel. In addition, despite Al Jazeera posing as a savior of Palestinians, prominent Palestinians have long expressed &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/afalkhatib/status/1987233366094323944&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://x.com/afalkhatib/status/1987233366094323944&quot;&gt;concerns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; that Al Jazeera has stirred up regional hostilities and fomented violence, a problem that would be amplified if Al Jazeera’s cleverly designed content is recast as neutral algorithmic outputs. News consumers would be hard-pressed to find examples of Al Jazeera criticizing Hamas’s atrocities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators should regard AI partnerships with foreign state-directed authoritarian media as they would regard sensitive technologies. They should trigger formal risk assessments. Congress should require companies with AI products to disclose the extent to which foreign state-directed media sources are used in training data, retrieval systems, or generated outputs. Absent such transparency, lawmakers and the public cannot evaluate the scale of foreign state influence embedded in AI-driven information systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google should also require clear labeling when AI-generated news summaries or analytical outputs rely on content from foreign state-directed media organizations. Users should not be left to assume neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing Americans and the global community from being manipulated by the Qatari state’s anti-Western, pro-extremist Al Jazeera content, even though it may be cloaked in high-tech flash, should be a top priority for both technology companies and policymakers. It’s time to pull back the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fdd-new.cmail19.com/t/r-l-tkdrnht-niytiidujr-ir/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://fdd-new.cmail19.com/t/r-l-tkdrnht-niytiidujr-ir/&quot;&gt;Toby Dershowitz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; is a senior advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, where Asher Boiskin is an intern.

      <title>Inside the $35 Billion Plan to Track Hypersonic Missiles from Space</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/inside-the-35-billion-plan-to-track-hypersonic-missiles-from-space</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION —&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The Department of Defense’s Space Development Agency (SDA) is developing a new space-based architecture comprised of a large constellation of at least 300-500 satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) to detect and track potential missile threats. This system will complement other space systems currently providing this capability. SDA is developing this new system in part in response to peer and near-peer competitors that are designing strategic and tactical hypersonic weapons that are not easily detected, identified, or tracked by current space-based missile warning systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a quote from a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report sent to Congress last Wednesday entitled &lt;em&gt;MISSILE WARNING SATELLITES, Space Development Agency Should &lt;/em&gt;Be&lt;em&gt; More Realistic and Transparent About Risks to Capability Delivery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve chosen to write about this report because it contains not only the best description of how complicated and costly just one aspect of missile defense has become, but also it provides the most understandable history of what’s been done up to now, along with the threats we face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known within the Defense Department (DoD) as the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) – and started in 2020 -- the plan, according to the GAO report, is “intended to provide space surveillance and communications for persistent, timely, global awareness [of missile threats] that is designed to operate in an increasingly contested space environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DoD so far has committed nearly $11 billion to this effort, which is programmed to cost near $35 billion through fiscal year 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the PWSA deals with tracking an already launched missile and its warhead, there are two other elements of a missile warning system: Detecting the launch and communicating information within elements of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, missile threats have been detected and tracked because they are launched using powerful rocket boosters which produce heat and light making them easy to initially see and follow and predict their ballistic trajectories. Infrared sensors on space satellites can detect heat from launched missiles and booster plumes against Earth’s background&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1970, DoD put in place the first Defense Support Program satellites, which used infrared sensors. These first satellites with infrared sensors, and the infrared systems that have followed, have operated from geosynchronous Earth orbits (GEO), which allow those satellites to stay fixed over a single, longitudinal spot located about 22,000 miles above Earth. This results in each GEO satellite maintaining constant observation of a specific area of the globe and collectively monitoring the entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1990s, DoD developed the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) to replace and provide significantly more robust data than the Defense Support Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday’s GAO report said, “In recent years, DoD has identified emerging threats that these [SBIRS] systems may be unable to effectively warn or defend against. For example, Russia and China have successfully demonstrated hypersonic missile capabilities. In addition to new missile threats posed by potential adversaries, DoD has also publicly acknowledged emerging threats to our space assets. For example, DoD reported that China is developing additional counterspace capabilities including directed energy weapons, electronic warfare, and other anti-satellite weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the GAO, “U.S. missile warning satellites currently operating in GEO may be particularly vulnerable to these emerging threats because there are relatively few of them -- making them high-value targets -- and their location above Earth is effectively stationary and predictable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately three DSP satellites of the original 23 DSP system remain in orbit with one maybe still operational. In addition, beginning in 2011 there have been six SBIR satellites put in orbit and SBIRS sensors placed on four additional host satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GAO report said, “SBIRS will soon be followed by the Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) system, designed as an upgraded replacement for SBIRS, with sensors that are expected to have even greater sensitivity than current SBIRS sensors. While providing some enhanced capabilities, such as greater sensitivity, the Next Gen OPIR system is built around an architecture similar to existing systems now in GEO orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DoD is also developing space-based laser communications technology to support large constellations of satellites for missions, including missile warning and data transport. However, a February 2025 GAO report found that DoD had “made progress in developing this technology, but it also faced delays and other issues -- and hasn't fully demonstrated that it works in space. Despite these challenges, DOD plans to continue to develop and launch hundreds of satellites worth billions of dollars that require the use of laser communications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DoD’s plan for the new PWSA missile satellites in LEO, internally referred to as the Tracking Layer, will complement the Next Gen OPIR satellites for what is termed missile warning/missile tracking (MW/MT) functions, and will use laser technology to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because satellites in LEO are much closer to Earth than those in GEO, many more satellites are needed in a LEO-based constellation to achieve the same coverage as a single one in GEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The missile tracking satellites in LEO are traveling much faster relative to Earth’s surface and therefore each satellite can only observe a small section of Earth’s surface for a short time -- only about 10 minutes. This makes constellation development more complicated if constant global coverage is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some DoD officials say having a greater number of satellites performing MW/MT in LEO will result in greater resiliency for the constellation as a whole and the capability it provides,” the GAO report says, adding, “For example, if one satellite in a proliferated constellation is damaged -- whether intentionally or by natural environmental effects -- the constellation’s capability is degraded by a smaller margin than if the entire constellation was made up of only a handful of satellites.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current plan has been to develop a large constellation of tracking satellites in LEO, along with data transport layer satellites forming a communications network to provide mission data directly that will enable advanced missile tracking from LEO to ground stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tracking satellite, according to the GAO report, is “comprised of a spacecraft – referred to as a bus -- plus other components such as infrared sensors, on-board mission data processors, and communication payloads, together with a ground segment to manage the constellation and receive and process track data to send to the wider DoD and intelligence community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be some 600 satellites in all, with plans then to replenish each tranche every two years in perpetuity, along with associated ground systems, according to the GAO report. As the LEO-orbiting tracking satellites approach the end of their life, “SDA will deorbit them,” the report says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SDA has been acquiring tranches of both tracking and data transport layer satellites beginning with a demonstration tranche, called Tranche 0 (T0) that was launched in April 2023. Of the 27 satellites in T0, 19 performed data transport and communications, while eight did missile warning. One additional satellite remained on the ground as a test bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tranche 0 was designed to be a “warfighter immersion” tranche, giving service members the opportunity to work with the systems, understand their capabilities, and to develop operational concepts for their use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An SDA official told the GAO T0 demonstrated “the ability to track a short-range ballistic missile throughout its flight and into its terminal phase and then transmit raw data to the ground from space.” It also connected the tactical data link network used by NATO, from space to specific ships and military airplanes and established the first satellite-to-satellite demonstration of optical links between two of the four T0 contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2025, Tranche 1 of the PWSA program, put 21 tracking satellites into orbit, followed the next month by another 21 data transport layer satellites. Overall, Tranche 1 is scheduled to consist of 128 satellites for the Transport Layer and 26 for the Tracking Layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SDA said back in October 2025, “Beginning in 2027, T1 will provide an initial warfighting capability through the PWSA to deliver regional persistence for tactical military data channels…along with advanced missile tracking and missile warning, and beyond-line-of-sight targeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday’s GAO report said, “According to SDA, T1 will establish the PWSA ground and operations baseline, or the foundation upon which SDA plans to add capabilities in future tranches. To reduce risk, SDA is taking an incremental approach to delivering these ground operations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the next T1 satellite launches have been delayed to sometime this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday’s GAO report raised significant issues in the ongoing PWSA program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, it said, “SDA had planned to allow the warfighter to provide feedback on capabilities prior to a larger SDA investment in T1 and future tranches, but officials from combatant commands we spoke to told us that they have not been asked to provide feedback on T0 MW/MT demonstrations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a broader sense, the GAO said, “SDA has not taken steps to understand the range of risks to delivering MW/MT capabilities by assessing the technological maturity -- such as by conducting a technology readiness assessment -- of critical technology elements included in its satellite development given required modifications and use in new environments. Absent such assessments, SDA remains overly reliant on technology maturity estimates provided by contractors and lacks key insights to better develop realistic development timelines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, as with many needed highly-technical and complex defense systems, this new space-based, large constellation of satellites in low Earth orbit to detect and track potential missile threats appears to be developing higher costs and a delay before it is fully operational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.
