      <title>Trump’s Supporters Should Be Careful What They Wish For</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the US Supreme Court upholds President Donald Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on US allies and adversaries alike, it will hand a loaded gun to future presidents. Why couldn't an administration use IEEPA tools to enforce a global minimum corporate tax or effectively ban crypto trading?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Trouble with Abundance</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/democrats-cannot-build-a-political-strategy-on-abundance-by-jeffrey-frankel-2025-10</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a book released earlier this year, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson argue essentially for “competent capacity”: a US that can effectively plan, approve, and execute projects. That is a worthy goal, but “abundance” is probably not the clearest way to convey it, let alone the most effective means of achieving it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Social Protection Can Accelerate Climate Action</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new report shows that the integration of climate objectives and social-protection systems can go a long way toward delivering finance where it is needed most. But making the most of these findings will require a new approach to designing, financing, and implementing social-protection programs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can China Meet Its Massive Climate-Finance Needs?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The costs of decarbonizing the four highest-emitting sectors in China dwarf those in other major emerging economies, with India coming in a distant second. But while the figures might seem daunting, they are well within reach for China, which should be able to meet its own climate-finance needs relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
