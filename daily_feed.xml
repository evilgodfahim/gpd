      <description>&lt;p&gt;By heaping abuse on Europe and handling Russia and China with kid gloves, the Trump administration's National Security Strategy represents a radical departure from past US policies. But even as America rejects everything it once stood for, Europeans' only choice is to double down on their own principles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite strong opposition in Congress, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has launched an ambitious industrial policy aimed at boosting renewable-energy capacity and expanding domestic defense capabilities.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under President Donald Trump, the United States is seeking to create a world order based solely on spheres of interest controlled by the US, China, and Russia. And because this will require breaking up the European Union, the decades-long transatlantic alliance has given way to enmity in remarkably short order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given the Trump administration’s recent statements and policy pronouncements, European leaders no longer have any excuse for failing to map out their own long-term security strategy. If they can get their act together on ending the Ukraine war, they will gain a much stronger position on other key fronts, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
