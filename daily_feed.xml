      <title>America’s Future Is Being Sacrificed for Short-Term “Wins”</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite a tumultuous year, markets continue to bet on American liquidity and growth. But while the outlook looks promising, the United States is systematically trading strategic advantages for tactical gains, and the costs are accumulating in ways that won’t become apparent until it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Agriculture for Security</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main factors contributing to food insecurity is conflict. Policymakers must start viewing agriculture as a strategic sector that not only sustains households, but also anchors fragile states, gives legitimacy to governments, and creates an opening for cooperation in an increasingly fragmented world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Critics and credit-rating agencies have been challenging the legitimacy of Afreximbank’s preferred creditor status. By casting doubt on the reliability of African institutions, they are threatening to undermine the continent's ability to build a sovereign financial architecture capable of supporting its structural transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While much of the AI debate focuses on its economic potential, its expanding physical footprint tells a different story. The machines driving this revolution depend on a resource far older – and far more contested – than data or electricity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Accountability for one’s actions is a bedrock principle of any society built on the rule of law. Yet while we understand human autonomy and the responsibilities that come with it, the workings of machine autonomy lie beyond our comprehension, making AI agents an obvious risk to democratic governance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
