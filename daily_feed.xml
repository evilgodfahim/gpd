      <description>&lt;p&gt;Terrorists are once again targeting Nigeria’s schools, kidnapping more than 300 children in recent weeks.

      <title>Trump’s Tariffs Are Hitting India Hard</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump’s punishing tariffs have laid bare the fragility of India’s export model, which depends on a handful of markets and a narrow band of relatively low-value-added products. Only by embracing a new model – which emphasizes diversification, regional cooperation, and value addition – can India build long-term resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;China has built the machinery of an innovative, low-carbon industrial economy capable of leading the global net-zero transition and the unfolding AI revolution.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The future Donald Trump's supporters want – a pre-feminist white Christian America – cannot be attained, which means his MAGA movement has no constructive program. It can only destroy, because nothing it can build would satisfy it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
