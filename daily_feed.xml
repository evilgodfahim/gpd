      <title>The New Global Order</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/new-global-order-us-china-russia-pressuring-neighbors-because-constrained-elsewhere-by-nancy-qian-2026-02</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the post-Cold War era recedes, a more regional and competitive order is reasserting itself. Under these conditions, it is not surprising that larger powers would seek to shape their immediate surroundings – not only out of ambition, but also because they face constraints farther afield.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Will Capping Credit-Card Interest Rates Help Ordinary Americans?</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/will-trump-cap-on-credit-card-interest-rates-benefit-americans-by-jeffrey-frankel-2026-02</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The federal cap on credit-card interest rates that US President Donald Trump has proposed would, in theory, prevent issuers from gouging customers. But not everyone agrees that this would be good for Americans, especially lower-income households that are often the most desperate for credit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Those Who Most Need to Understand AI Don’t Get It</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While anyone familiar with past technological hype cycles can see that today’s predominantly young technologists are overly optimistic about AI’s potential benefits, mainstream economists seem to suffer from tunnel vision of a different sort. If recent history is any guide, that should worry us all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Media Literacy Isn’t Enough Anymore</title>
      <link>https://www.thecipherbrief.com/media-literacy-isnt-enough-anymore</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPINION — &lt;/strong&gt;For years, media literacy has been treated as the solution to misinformation. I've advocated that position as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teach people to question headlines. Encourage them to check sources. Help them recognize bias and emotional manipulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that still matters. In fact, it matters more than ever. I often encourage people to think like intelligence analysts when they encounter information online. Pause. Ask who benefits. Look for what is missing. Compare across sources. Pay attention to emotion. Those skills are essential. They are part of being an informed citizen in a digital world. And yet, they are no longer sufficient on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The information environment has changed in ways that place unprecedented strain on individual judgment. AI-generated content now moves at a scale and speed no human can comfortably keep up with. Synthetic images, audio, and video are increasingly realistic. Recommendation engines quietly shape what we see first, what we see repeatedly, and what we never see at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even people who are informed and motivated can feel overwhelmed. Not because they lack critical thinking, but because the environment itself is engineered for constant engagement and reaction. Volume replaces deliberation. Speed crowds out reflection. This creates a subtle but important shift in responsibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-related&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When every individual is expected to function as a full-time analyst, constantly verifying and filtering, fatigue sets in. Naturally, people disengage. Or they rely on shortcuts. Familiar narratives feel safer. Emotion becomes a guide. Over time, trust erodes, not only in information, but in the idea that careful judgment is even possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where the conversation needs to broaden. Individual literacy and critical thinking remain necessary. We should continue to teach people how to evaluate information and resist online manipulation. At the same time, we have to recognize that resilience cannot rest entirely on individual effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthy societies depend on environments that support human cognition. Spaces that allow for pause. Systems that introduce friction in high-risk moments instead of eliminating it. Norms and designs that make room for judgment rather than constantly competing for attention. Freedom has always depended on those moments when humans decide what matters, rather than being swept along by momentum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world optimized for speed and engagement, protecting those moments may be one of the most important things we can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals. Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, India has built the world’s largest real-time payments system. By using public infrastructure to expand financial inclusion, it offers a model for other developing countries that want to modernize payments without being dependent on a few multinational corporations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next phase of the clean-energy revolution will be led not by those who build more solar panels, but by those who modernize their grids, markets, and institutions accordingly. In fact, AI-ready grids will be as crucial to the Global South’s development as traditional infrastructure like roads and ports.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
