      <description>&lt;p&gt;In October, Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East, predicted that his team could negotiate a peace deal between Algeria and Morocco in 60 days. But de-escalating this long-standing rivalry requires a coherent US strategy that merges diplomacy, defense, energy, and development policy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given that China is the world’s largest emitter and has a high carbon intensity, some assume that its trade war with the United States, which has shifted production to third countries, would have environmental benefits. In fact, the conflict has increased carbon dioxide emissions in developing and advanced economies alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From transaction-processing bottlenecks to data-validation delays, a number of factors make stablecoins poorly suited to retail and even wholesale payments. Crucially, the barriers to widespread use of stablecoins are structural: they cannot be overcome without fundamentally transforming how the instrument works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Iran's flailing response to a nationally destabilizing water crisis should be a warning to everyone. As more societies push up against planetary boundaries, they will confront threats to their very survival, and responses that once seemed drastic or utopian will begin to look like common sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today’s geopolitical turmoil has undermined the multilateral institutions that have structured international relations since the end of World War II. To avoid a slide into global anarchy, we must begin complementing existing institutions with a patchwork of arrangements that are less formal, less universal, and less binding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
