      <description>&lt;p&gt;Europe’s debate over the process of making Ukraine a full member is often framed as a test of resolve; but credibility is based as much on capacity as on intent. If promises cannot be sustained politically, they will eventually be broken, and the fallout will be strategically damaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
