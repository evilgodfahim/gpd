      <title>Is China’s Economic Policy Too Cautious?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that the old growth model has run its course, China’s leaders have embraced a measured economic strategy, focused on “high-quality development,” stability, and risk management. But they must not be so cautious that they fail to address the imbalances that may become hard constraints on the economy's long-term prospects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The central challenge for educators in the age of AI is to prepare students to operate effectively in the face of uncertainty.

      <title>Appeasing Trump Only Invites Betrayal - as Europe’s Far Right Just Learned</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With Donald Trump laying claim to Greenland, Europeans have finally realized who they are dealing with. The US president is animated less by the prospect of deal-making than by the need for domination, less by the spirit of exchange than by the perverse pleasure of belittling others and exalting himself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
