And yet, the institutions that comprise innovation systems have become semi-fossilized in many countries, and policymakers rarely think about how to reform them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Countries across the Middle East are facing acute water shortages, owing to poor resource management, accelerating climate change, and regional power politics.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite its vast renewables potential, Africa’s clean-energy transition is being impeded by deepening economic and debt pressures.
