      <title>The Energy Transition Is Achievable in Emerging Markets</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A decade or so ago, a consensus emerged that the energy transition would require massive amounts of capital. But, according to new research into high-emitting sectors in nine major emerging-market economies, power generation will require the least amount of climate finance to shift from fossil fuels to renewables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>China’s Rare-Earth Own Goal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whereas the conventional wisdom holds that the US depends on Chinese rare earths, putting it at a severe geopolitical disadvantage, it is actually China that depends on the US (and others) for higher value-added rare-earth compounds. Any Chinese restrictions on rare-earth exports are thus likely to hurt China most of all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The current geopolitical environment is arguably not conducive to pursuing reparations for slavery and colonialism. But Africa and its diaspora in the Americas, the Caribbean, and Europe continue to make headway, with a focus not only on seeking financial compensation but also on ending racial discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Japan’s first female prime minister, Takaichi Sanae, presents herself as a leader who can be tougher than the men. This, combined with her hawkish views on immigration and defense, suggests that Takaichi will not use her position to help other women crack the glass ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the economic consensus for the US economy anticipates moderate, steady GDP growth and inflation heading toward 2%, the recent strength of both gold and tech stocks is a signal that investors should not ignore. One way or another, structural economic change is coming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
