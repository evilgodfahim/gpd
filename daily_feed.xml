      <title>Why Peace in Ukraine Remains a Distant Prospect</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-ukraine-russia-peace-remains-a-distant-prospect-by-ian-bremmer-2025-12</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When two warring parties’ core objectives are fundamentally incompatible, no amount of external pressure or diplomacy can bridge the gap between them. Peace in Ukraine will come eventually, but it almost certainly will not come from US President Donald Trump's current diplomatic push, no matter how many deadlines he sets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Climate change is rapidly melting the glaciers that feed Central Asia’s rivers, pushing the region toward an ecological tipping point. Against this backdrop, a new initiative aims to revive a long-abandoned plan to redirect part of Siberia’s freshwater to its southern neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Japan’s new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, was not wrong when she recently said that the country must be prepared to defend itself even beyond its borders. But she would be in a stronger position to strengthen Japan’s military muscle if she were willing to reckon with her political forebears’ war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump’s Ukraine Peace Plan Means More War</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/trump-s-ukraine-peace-plan-means-more-war</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After attempting to impose draconian peace terms on Ukraine, the US delegation responsible for negotiating with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who all but dictated those terms, has once again failed to achieve a breakthrough. Even if the Trump administration does manage to get a peace agreement signed, what it contains – and what it omits – is likely to be a formula for renewed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By rejecting all four ballot measures in a recent referendum, Ecuadorian voters demonstrated an understanding that neither their right-wing president, Daniel Noboa, nor Donald Trump seems to share. Militarizing poor neighborhoods and inviting US troops is no way to resolve a security crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is no accident that aspiring autocrats try to exert control over higher education, given universities' potential to become sites of resistance and promoters of &quot;democratic competence.&quot; The real question is why university leaders have not done more to anticipate the far right's latest onslaught.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
