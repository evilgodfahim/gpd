      <title>What AI Means for Growth and Jobs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While many commentators warn that AI will undermine employment and offer only modest productivity gains, empirical studies continue to suggest otherwise. With the right policies in place, the technology holds immense potential to drive both growth and employment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Turning the spotlight on the King while letting the barons off the hook will not stop Donald Trump and his copycats from amassing feudal powers. The illusion of the strong man who will fix everything cannot be dispelled by reviving the illusion that oligarchy offers the population democratic choices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Will AI Bury Future Generations in Cognitive Debt?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As companies seek to automate repetitive tasks in the name of cost-cutting, they should consider the longer-term implications. If we transfer all codified knowledge to machines, we will bequeath to future generations a world where it will be ever harder to learn by doing, to achieve mastery, and thus to aspire to creative freedom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s increasingly multipolar world, the rise of geopolitical conflicts has been a boon for competitive authoritarian regimes. Russia’s war against Ukraine, for example, strengthened the domestic positions of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ahead of pivotal elections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
