      <title>America Will Pay for Pushing India Away</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to New Delhi should be a wake-up call for the United States: attempting to coerce India into actions that compromise its national interest is a recipe for estrangement. Given that India remains crucial to balance China’s aggressive rise, such an outcome would carry high costs for the US.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new US National Security Strategy represents a decisive departure from the universalist values that have guided US foreign policy since 1945. Its nativist, anti-liberal stance should dispel any remaining European illusions about the current state of the transatlantic alliance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The European Union cannot reduce its digital dependence by investing in infrastructure that leaves underlying power relationships intact. Real power comes from controlling the parts of the value chain that shape decision-making, govern data flows, and set the standards that structure digital markets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's new National Security Strategy envisions a world in which the United States no longer anchors alliances and international institutions, stands up for democracy and human rights, and seeks to uphold the global balance of power.
