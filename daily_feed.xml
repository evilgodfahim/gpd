      <description>&lt;p&gt;Convinced that nationalism belongs to the past, liberals have largely abandoned appeals to cultural identity, allowing far-right political entrepreneurs to fill the void. To counter exclusionary nationalism, liberals must craft a unifying creed that restores a sense of shared destiny.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For rudderless center-left parties, the debate around asylum and immigration should be seen not as a necessary evil, but as a political opportunity. By anchoring tougher enforcement in an authentic social-democratic agenda, the left can show that it has better solutions than the far right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While critics of decentralized technology regulation warn of higher compliance costs for businesses, Chinese-style centralization is hardly preferable. In fact, not only do regulatory patchworks tend to converge, but they also provide the flexibility that rapid technological change demands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Climate tipping points can seem like science fiction, making them difficult to monitor and mitigate. To ensure that tipping-point dynamics are a central consideration in infrastructure planning, financial regulation, and development policy, regional bodies must develop the capacity to track and respond to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although most economists have issued dire warnings about the damage tariffs and other ill-advised policies would cause, the US economy’s aggregate indicators have remained quite robust. Some of the costs may simply have been postponed, but rapid advances in AI could well offset them when they fall due.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
