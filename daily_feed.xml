      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is facing an inequality crisis fueled by stagnant wages, eroding social protections, and the extreme concentration of wealth.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Ireland to Palestine, the 20th century’s partitions promised stability but delivered bloodshed, animosity, and ethnic cleansing. A new book traces how the breakup of the British Indian Empire unleashed a chain of upheavals that redefined South Asia and shaped the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
