      <description>&lt;p&gt;While most people regard the Sino-American rivalry as a new cold war between two world-bestriding giants, the truth is that both countries are tightly constrained. Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping each sense the other side's vulnerabilities, which means they cannot hide their own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To rebuild the middle class, reduce global poverty, and address climate change simultaneously, we need to depart from established ways of thinking and consider new approaches. Fortunately, many of these approaches already exist at the local level, where they have proved themselves and need only to be recognized.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Western leaders favor the language of “polycrisis” because it obscures the root cause of our current predicament: the industrial-colonial paradigm. Instead of focusing on fear, the world must study and tackle development challenges with a purposeful realism that draws on the creativity of a genuinely global community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Russians were promised a quick victory in Ukraine; instead, they have gotten a protracted and costly conflict reminiscent of the Afghan quagmire that contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. None of this is lost on President Vladimir Putin, who is ramping up prosecutions to eliminate potential rivals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the absence of political will, the law has become a crucial driver of climate progress. Recent rulings make it clear that countries have binding legal duties to cut emissions, phase out fossil fuels, and finance adaptation efforts, laying the groundwork for stronger commitments at COP30.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When millions of protesters came out this month to say, “No Kings,” Donald Trump posted an AI-generated video of himself being crowned, only to insist, the next day, that he is not a king. But how he sees himself ultimately matters less than how Congress, the courts, the business community, and the electorate do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
